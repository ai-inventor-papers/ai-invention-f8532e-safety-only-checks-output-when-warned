**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
Your own tokens are the scarcest and most expensive resource in this run. Your job is to decompose the work, delegate it, coordinate, decide, verify briefly, and synthesize. It is not to work through the pieces yourself.

Delegate by default (e.g. with the Task tool): anything beyond a trivial step goes to a subagent, even when it is one sequential task with nothing to split. Running a script, debugging a failure, reading a long output or log, searching the repo or the literature, drafting text: all of it is subagent work, and so is a loop of write code, run it, read the output, fix, rerun. The reason is context isolation, not only parallelism. Every stdout dump, traceback and dead end a subagent absorbs is one that never enters your context; only its conclusion comes back. Keep a step for yourself only when one obvious search-free action beats the handoff, such as a one-line edit or a single lookup.

- Pick the cheapest tier that can do the job:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Raise the tier only after a cheaper one has failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Split orthogonal pieces by file or artifact ownership up front, one subagent per piece, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Keep handoffs short: objective, exact scope, constraints, acceptance check, output format. Ask for findings back as text.
- Subagents report only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers, never narration or full logs.
- What stays with you: the decisions, a short sanity check on what came back (one bash command, one file read), and the integration. Do not redo a subagent's work.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_5/art_iVXKySzvTVVk`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_5/art_iVXKySzvTVVk/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_5/art_iVXKySzvTVVk/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_5/art_iVXKySzvTVVk/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
A SHARED CACHE ALREADY EXISTS FOR THIS RUN: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/.shared_cache`
`HF_HOME`, `HF_HUB_CACHE`, `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`,
`TORCH_HOME`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR` and `UV_CACHE_DIR` are ALREADY set to point
there. Every step and every iteration of this run shares it, so a model or
dataset an earlier experiment downloaded is already on disk for you.

DO NOT override those variables. In particular do NOT write the common
pattern `os.environ["HF_HOME"] = <workspace>/hf_cache` — `HF_HOME` and
`TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` are read differently by `huggingface_hub` (one has
`/hub` appended, the other does not), so pointing both at one directory
stores every weight TWICE. That mistake cost one run 25 GB of identical
blobs. If you must set them, use the values above verbatim.

YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision:

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Rechecking every disputed number from saved data
summary: >-
  Zero-GPU, $0 re-derivation audit of every blocking number in the iteration-4 draft, recomputed from iteration-2/3/4 JSON
  and .npy on disk (disk wins over prose). PRIMARY METRIC: claim_match_rate = 0.6866 (46/67 verifiable claims, frozen prereg
  tolerances; 1 UNVERIFIABLE, 0 SOURCE_ABSENT reported separately). Post-hoc rounding-aware secondary 0.7612. Four deliverable
  ledgers were adjudicated under ONE rule (duplicates dropped, 3 category errors withdrawn, 5 verdicts reversed by the frozen
  rule). Self-check gate PASSED on all 6 rules: 11/11 deliverables, 1324 rows all with source_file+readout_class, 32 candidate
  rows, 0 sentences naming a baseline as the deliverable (gate regex unit-tested), prereg sha unchanged. Full pipeline reruns
  deterministically. KEY CORRECTIONS: (1) the frozen count rule makes the effective set 10, not 9 (AMD-OLMo SFT->DPO; 11 under
  a literal reading). The iter-3/iter-4 disagreement on it is GENERATION PROVENANCE, not item sets. Re-scoring changes only
  B7 (7/9->8/10, the OLMo all-ones-null artefact). (2) The defensible false-alarm test is BL1_easy 4/12 vs N1 1/12, exact
  McNemar p=0.375: UNDERPOWERED, not negative. (3) No FA/sensitivity trade-off: Spearman is POSITIVE (0.406 within the activation
  class, 0.596 across all 32). (4) Judged refusal is BOUNDED: max |effect| 0.056 vs MDE80 0.067/0.061/0.098, TOST equivalent
  in all 3 models. The Holm survivor ranks 4th by |effect|; global ablation is B4, not B5; the registered DiD is NOT SUPPORTED
  (8/18). R displaces 2.5x/2.0x MORE than F off site P. (5) Bitwise explanation deleted: 25.6% text identity vs 96.5% label
  agreement across devices; BL1 moves 6.23x more than activation readouts. (6) Commission part 3: request-axis d detects abliteration
  8/8 (verified from per-pair CIs), but N1 REVERSES on mylesgoose; 'few' means ~32 prompts; RANKING needs about 30-150 checkpoints
  (Williams' power; prereg rule says 55), not 10. (7) Abliteration ROTATES N6 (cos 0.02-0.06 at B4-B6); magnitude is NOT preserved
  (-16%). Contribution 2 corrected to 11/12 inert. (8) BL1 ranking flip withdrawn as variant- and panel-specific. D11 join:
  COULD_NOT_COMPLETE (no survivor committed; substrate manifest n=0; labels never opened). Read SUMMARY.md first; results/contradictions.json
  holds the ledger.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-f8532e-safety-only-checks-output-when-warned
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-f8532e-safety-only-checks-output-when-warned/main/round-5/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-f8532e-safety-only-checks-output-when-warned/main/round-5/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json
from pathlib import Path

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    local = Path("mini_demo_data.json")
    if local.exists(): return json.loads(local.read_text())
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-f8532e-safety-only-checks-output-when-warned/main/round-5/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

qwen3 4B on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated (use the 4B size of each so they fit on a 16GB GPU). take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

invariant: the deliverable is the activation-level comparison of the three models and any metric built from it must read activations or weights of a single model. logit-only or text-only readouts are baselines, not the result. this is a mech interp study of where safety lives, not a jailbreak or attack-selection study; do not reframe it as one.

---

## Colab Runtime (as of 2026-02)

- **Python**: 3.12.12
- **OS**: Linux 6.6.105+ x86_64, glibc 2.35

## Critical Rule: Do NOT pip install pre-installed packages ON COLAB

Colab's core scientific packages have **compiled C extensions** linked against each other at specific ABI versions. Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:

- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)
- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)
- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals

**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**
**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.

## Pre-installed Core Packages

These are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.

```
numpy==2.0.2
pandas==2.2.2
scikit-learn==1.6.1
scipy==1.16.3
matplotlib==3.10.0
seaborn==0.13.2
torch==2.9.0+cpu
tensorflow==2.19.0
xgboost==3.1.3
lightgbm==4.6.0
networkx==3.6.1
Pillow==11.3.0
opencv-python==4.13.0.92
sympy==1.14.0
statsmodels==0.14.6
bokeh==3.7.3
plotly==5.24.1
nltk==3.9.1
spacy==3.8.11
transformers==5.0.0
datasets==4.0.0
tokenizers==0.22.2
huggingface_hub==1.4.0
openai==2.17.0

Cython==3.0.12
numba==0.60.0
dask==2025.12.0
polars==1.31.0
pyarrow==18.1.0
```

## Install Cell Pattern

The install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)
_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')

# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')
```

**How this works:**
- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` → skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) → only installs non-Colab packages
- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` → installs core packages at Colab's exact versions → local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible

Rules:
- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.
- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.
- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.
- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` — corrupts Colab system packages.
- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` — use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.
- `%%capture` hides install noise — only add AFTER testing is done.
- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab — find an older version or alternative.

### Example

Code imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# imodels, dit — NOT on Colab, always install
_pip('imodels==2.0.4')
_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')

# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich — pre-installed on Colab, install locally only
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')
```

### Checking if a package is pre-installed

Before adding a package to the install cell, check:
1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?
2. If unsure, skip it — Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.

## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages

Colab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:

- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`

**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):

```python
import numpy as np
if not hasattr(np, "alltrue"): np.alltrue = np.all
if not hasattr(np, "sometrue"): np.sometrue = np.any
if not hasattr(np, "product"): np.product = np.prod
```

**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.

## Colab-Specific Gotchas

1. **No kernel restart after pip install** — Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.

2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** — In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.

3. **File system** — `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.

4. **Memory** — Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.

5. **Timeouts** — Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.

6. **`%%capture`** — Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.

## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)

The goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```

**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**
1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)
2. The install cell runs → `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules
3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally
4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard
5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible

This ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.

Workspace: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_5/art_iVXKySzvTVVk

Objective: test-execute `code_demo.ipynb` in a clean venv simulating Colab, and fix any errors so it runs end-to-end.

Steps (run from that workspace dir, absolute paths):
```
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
```
Then `rm -rf .nb_env` when done.

Constraints:
- Make MINIMAL fixes to the notebook (it is an annotated port of an original script; do not refactor, rename or restructure).
- Do NOT change GITHUB_DATA_URL (the URL is not live yet; the loader is expected to fall back to the local mini_demo_data.json in the workspace — that is correct behaviour).
- Do NOT change the frozen TOL values or the verdict logic.
- Do NOT write any file outside that workspace.
- Edit the .ipynb JSON directly with python/sed if needed.
- The final notebook must be left EXECUTED (outputs present) and error-free.

Acceptance check: `python3 -c "import json;nb=json.load(open('code_demo.ipynb'));print([o['output_type'] for c in nb['cells'] for o in c.get('outputs',[])].count('error'))"` prints 0, and the last cell's stdout contains a line starting with 'PRIMARY METRIC  claim_match_rate'.

Report back: whether it passed, total wall-clock runtime of the nbconvert execute, the printed value of claim_match_rate and whether 'REPRODUCED EXACTLY: True' appeared, and a one-line description of each fix you made (if any).

<CRITICAL_ERROR>
The module-end file check FAILED (attempt 1/3).

THESE PATHS HAVE NO DECISION (one line per directory, with sizes):
  .nb_env/  369670 B  [virtualenv (pyvenv.cfg)]

FIX IT:
1. Add one entry per uncovered path to `.aii/manifest.yaml` (create it if missing).
   Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve inside it. Globs and
   whole directories are fine — a whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry.

   entries:
     - path: results/
       keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible in this run
     - path: hf_cache/
       delete: redownloadable
       source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
     - path: checkpoints/
       delete: regenerable
       source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3"

   `keep:` takes a one-line reason. `delete:` takes `redownloadable` or
   `regenerable` and a `source:` that brings the files back.
2. Make sure `README.md` reads like a GitHub repository README: what you did,
   the layout (a line per important file/dir), how to run it, and a
   "Restoring removed files" section with the command for EVERY delete entry.
3. Text and code files never need a decision, and neither does anything under
   the auto-keep floor. Only large binaries and cache directories do.
