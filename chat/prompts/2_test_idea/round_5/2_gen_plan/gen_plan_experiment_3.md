<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
Delegation to subagents (e.g. the Task tool) is REQUIRED, not optional, whenever the work splits into two or more independent pieces: modules, files, datasets, experiments, checks, or literature threads that do not depend on each other's output. The only exception is a step that is a single short edit or lookup, with nothing to split, so do it yourself.

Your job is to decompose the work, hand every bounded piece to a subagent with a precise brief and acceptance check, then integrate and verify what comes back, not to work through the pieces yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.
</subagent-delegation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/`:

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Safety is how deep, not how strong
hypothesis: |-
  THE CLAIM IN ONE SENTENCE. Four consecutive screens have shown that every cheap single-model readout of the LEVEL of harmful-versus-benign separability -- Cohen's d at the best layer, the Fisher cluster ratio, AMS sigma, and the final-layer refusal-logit gap -- is ONE coordinate measured four ways, so iteration 5 abandons levels entirely and screens a population of 13 SECOND-ORDER readouts that measure how a checkpoint's safety representation is USED rather than how large it is: how much displacing it moves the model's OWN downstream computation, how many sites must be removed together before it collapses, how much later layers write it back, and how it is oriented relative to the benign-twin axis. The registered target is OVER-REFUSAL, the outcome no internal readout has ever been scored against, with harmful compliance and edit-robustness as co-primaries and a hard pre-screen that drops any candidate correlating above |0.5| with the logit gap BEFORE any outcome is read.

  WHY THE QUANTITY CLASS CHANGES AND NOT THE SCALAR. Iteration 3 diagnosed the cause of three straight nulls: across 25 checkpoints every activation candidate correlated 0.71-0.79 with BL1, because all of them were separability levels on the request axis that BL1 expresses. Iteration 4 did not repeat that screen; it changed the criterion to specificity and two-sidedness, and it still produced no survivor. The correct reading is that the level coordinate is saturated and is owned by AMS (arXiv:2608.05578, Apache-2.0, reference-free, 16 pairs, 40-80% depth, Pearson -0.546 / Spearman -0.423 n.s., LOO threshold accuracy 71%). A fifth level is not a candidate. What iteration 4's own causal grid produced instead is a second coordinate that no level readout can see, and that is what the new population is built from.

  MECHANISM, and why each direction is predicted rather than hoped for. A level says the model CAN tell a harmful request from a benign one. It says nothing about whether the model ACTS on that distinction, how many places it is written, or whether it can distinguish a genuinely harmful request from one that merely looks alarming. Those three are separable properties of the same representation, and iteration 4 measured all three moving independently of the level:
   (a) DECODABLE BUT INERT. Removing the fitted request axis F at the last prompt token in bands B4-B6 moves the instruct model's first-token refusal-onset mass by -2.87 / -2.59 / -1.58 nats and drops a keyword refusal proxy from 0.79 to 0.15 (B4; 0.19 at B5, 0.31 at B6), while JUDGED refusal does not move in any of 18 cells in either Qwen3-4B instruct or SafeRL (max |effect| 0.056 against a median 80%-power MDE of 0.067 for instruct and 0.061 for SafeRL). The model rewords its refusal. So the level is real, readable and locally inert: exactly the read-versus-write dissociation Basu 2603.18353 (SAE arm) and Galeone 2606.24952 report, now at site resolution inside one model.
   (b) REDUNDANCY IS THE THING THAT DIFFERS BETWEEN CHECKPOINTS AT EQUAL LEVEL. Ablating F at ALL positions in band B4 drops instruct judged refusal 0.917 -> 0.667 (effect -0.33 [-0.48,-0.21]) while SafeRL resists, difference-in-differences +0.229 [+0.083,+0.375]. Instruct and SafeRL have nearly the same LEVEL (N1 2.45 vs 2.34) and nearly the same axis (cos(F_instruct,F_SafeRL) >= 0.84 in every band), so the level cannot express the difference between them but redundancy can. This is the single strongest mechanism-level reason to expect a positive result.
   (c) ABLITERATION ROTATES, IT DOES NOT SHRINK. For mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated, cos with the parent's F is 0.999 / 0.994 / 0.943 in B1-B3 and 0.412 / 0.306 / 0.328 in B4-B6; for the benign-twin axis N6 it collapses from 0.997 at B1 to 0.021 / 0.027 / 0.061 at B4-B6 while its MAGNITUDE barely moves (1.79 vs the parent's 1.87). Removing the abliterated model's OWN F raises its refusal-onset mass, a sign reversal no level readout can represent. So a self-fitted rotation-under-self-lesion statistic is parent-free and sees exactly what a magnitude misses.
   (d) THE BENIGN SIDE IS THE ONLY CAUSAL LEVER FOUND. F and N6 at bands B4-B5 lower hard-benign over-refusal by 0.12-0.19 in BOTH models (instruct N6 @ P_B5 -0.146 [-0.24,-0.06], the only cell surviving Holm-18; SafeRL arm-F -0.188 at B4 and -0.167 at B5, and SafeRL N6 -0.118 / -0.160 / -0.146 at B4/B5/B6). Over-refusal is where these directions are write-handles; harmful refusal is where they are inert. A metric should therefore be registered on the outcome where the mechanism actually acts, and iteration 4's prior-art pass reports that cell OPEN everywhere: no per-checkpoint internal readout has ever been scored against over-refusal as its target.

  WHAT ITERATION 4 ACTUALLY PRODUCED (executed numbers, re-read from results/aggregates.json and results/classification.json, with the paper's misstatements corrected).
   (1) THE SPECIFICITY RESULT IS REAL BUT SMALLER THAN THE DRAFT CLAIMS, AND PARTLY ANALYTIC. Over 15 behaviourally graded no-op pairs and 9 effective pairs in three families (Qwen3-0.6B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Falcon3-1B-Instruct), false alarms fired by paired-bootstrap CI exclusion: N6 0/15, AMS T1 0/15, N4 0/15, N8 0/15, N1 1/15, C7 1/15, N11 2/15, C13_peak_d 3/15, N12 3/15, BL1_easy 6/15, BL1_hard 6/15, BL1_truelogit 8/15, B7 and B7_nullproj 9/15. Median no-op displacement: BL1_easy 0.150 null SD against N1 0.024 and N6 0.012. BUT the 15 no-ops are 8 numerical-precision arms, 3 head-only unembedding edits, 2 system-prompt swaps, 1 DPO and 1 rank-one lesion at alpha 0.5 -- there are NO re-downloads (the three re-saves are trivially zero and were excluded) and NO LoRA arms (all three were OR_EFFECTIVE or AMBIGUOUS). Three of the 15 (the wu05 head-only edits) have prompt-site activation delta EXACTLY ZERO by construction, and the two system-prompt arms cannot move AMS because AMS reads raw text. Restricted to the 12 pairs where both classes have a non-degenerate null, the comparison is BL1_easy 4/12 against N1 1/12. That is still a gap, and it is the gap the next paper must report.
   (2) SENSITIVITY IS THE BINDING FAILURE, NOT SPECIFICITY. Every activation candidate detects at most 6 of 9 effective changes, and NOT ONE of them detects AMD-OLMo base -> SFT in the expected direction (N1's delta is +0.294 [+0.038,+0.486], CI excluding zero but WRONG-SIGNED). The two most sensitive activation rows are the two least specific (C13_peak_d and N11, both 6/9, at 3/15 and 2/15), so the specificity-sensitivity trade-off runs straight THROUGH the activation class and not along the activation-versus-logit boundary the draft claims.
   (3) TWO TEXT BARS DOMINATE THE WHOLE TABLE AND MUST BE CONCEDED IN THE ABSTRACT. The model-card/name regex scores 0/15 false alarms and 5/9 sensitivity, tying N1 on BOTH axes with zero forward passes. The greedy refusal-text rate scores 2/15 and 7/8, the best sensitivity in the table, and it is one of only two rows that detects AMD base -> SFT. Under the run invariant these are baselines, not deliverables, but a deliverable that a card regex ties is not yet a deliverable, and the only axes on which these bars are structurally blind are over-refusal prediction and causal write-handle strength -- which is precisely where the new population is registered.
   (4) THE PREREGISTERED BAR WAS UNATTAINABLE BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. The rule demanded a median no-op displacement at least 1.0 null SD BELOW BL1's; N1's achieved gap is -0.126 because BL1 itself only moves 0.150. The bar was written before BL1's magnitude was known. The next rule must be stated in units that can be reached.
   (5) THE CAUSAL GRID IS THE RUN'S FIRST EXECUTED INTERVENTION RESULT and is reported above as mechanism (a)-(d). Its limits are stated with it: the abliterated arm ran 6 cells at site P only (not 18), its arm-0 refusal is 0.188 and over-refusal 0.042 so it is a floor effect, there is NO judged-refusal positive control (the POS arm ran at B3/B4 forward-only, RD_harm -4.170 at B4), and the registered difference-in-differences "instruct over-refusal falls more" is NOT supported.
   (6) THE PAPER'S CROSS-VARIANT CLAIM IS BROKEN AND IS WITHDRAWN. "BL1 ranks SafeRL below instruct (3.07 vs 4.99)" is the iteration-2 lens convention (double final RMSNorm); the literal logit gap on EASY stimuli is 6.650 for instruct against 7.498 for SafeRL, so the ordering REVERSES with the variant. The two over-refusal measurements also disagree (XSTest twins 0.11 instruct / 0.00 SafeRL; hard-benign probes 0.438 instruct / 0.479 SafeRL). Both must be labelled by variant and by prompt set everywhere, and the flip is itself a legitimate finding about the fragility of logit readouts.
   (7) PRIOR ART (iteration-4 pass, 62/62 passages re-verified). The cell is OPEN but narrower. Nearest new work: 2609.18471 "First Token Matters" (decode-site readout, logit lens, two-sided steering, XSTest, but no no-op controls, 2 checkpoints) and Duan 2606.15980 (frozen probes across 12 quantisation/LoRA/QLoRA updates, per-input AUC, no graded behaviour, big-drop rates 43-54%). Surviving claim: a per-checkpoint audit on BEHAVIOURALLY GRADED no-ops, plus over-refusal as the TARGET of an internal readout, plus the logit gap AND AMS sigma side by side, plus a site-local matched-norm versus orthogonalised-random causal test.

  THE CANDIDATE POPULATION (13 readouts in three families; 16 alternatives weighed in total, counting the three competing prediction targets). Every candidate reads the activations or weights of ONE model, needs no parent and no judge, and uses at most 32 prompts. Intervention candidates cost roughly 6 bands x 32 prompts x 2 arms of forward passes, which is seconds on the L4 -- the ask constrains PROMPTS, not passes, and that is stated explicitly.
   FAMILY I -- WRITE-HANDLE AND REDUNDANCY (the new coordinate; every one is reported net of a matched-norm orthogonalised random direction R at identical displacement).
    W1 SITE-LOCAL WRITE GAIN: the displacement of the model's own downstream internal refusal representation caused by proj

ecting its own request axis F out at band b, minus the R control, maximised over b. Purely activation-side in and out.
    W2 REDUNDANCY DEPTH: the smallest number of bands whose JOINT ablation drives that downstream representation below half its unperturbed value. Predicted ordering Base < instruct < SafeRL.
    W3 POSITIONAL REDUNDANCY RATIO: all-position ablation effect divided by last-prompt-token-only effect in the same band. Registered directly off the executed instruct 0.917->0.667 versus SafeRL DiD +0.229 contrast.
    W4 SELF-REPAIR COEFFICIENT: the fraction of the ablated component that later layers write back by the end of the stack. This is the internal form of "the model rewords its refusal" and must be reported against the field's known backup/hydra-effect precedent rather than named as new.
    W5 BENIGN-SIDE WRITE GAIN: W1 computed for the XSTest benign-twin axis on hard-benign prompts. The over-refusal lever, per checkpoint.
    W6 SIGNED TWO-SIDED GAIN W5 - W1: two-sided by construction, and a quantity BL1 cannot have.
    W7 DECODE-SITE WRITE GAIN: W1 read at the model's own first 1-8 greedy decode positions.
    W8 ROTATION UNDER SELF-LESION: cosine between the model's own axis before and after its own fixed-strength rank-one self-lesion, parent-free by construction, registered off the executed 0.412/0.306/0.328 and 0.021/0.027/0.061 rotations.
   FAMILY II -- DIMENSIONLESS GEOMETRY OF USE (ratios and angles, so they escape both the null-SD scaling problem and the level collinearity).
    G1 HARMFUL-VERSUS-BENIGN-TWIN ANGLE at the model's own best band.
    G2 THREE-CLUSTER MARGIN RATIO d(harmful, hard-benign) / d(hard-benign, plain-benign). A blanket refuser sits near zero; this is the internal analogue of safe engagement.
    G3 USED-NESS: cosine between the fitted axis and the residual delta the band's own layers actually add on harmful prompts -- whether the model writes along the axis it can be read on.
    G4 BL1-ORTHOGONAL FISHER RATIO: the separation computed in the subspace orthogonal to the unembedding's refusal-token rows, carried forward as the one level-family candidate that is BL1-residual by construction.
   FAMILY III -- THE COMPETING CLAIM, carried so both outcomes are informative.
    P1 THE ONE-COORDINATE HYPOTHESIS: that nothing beats BL1 because a single-model cheap readout has only ONE usable coordinate, so every second-order quantity will also collapse onto it. P1 is tested by the pre-screen in (ii) below, not by a new readout, and if it wins the paper states it as the bound: the cheap-metric programme is capped by the request axis, and that is a result the field would act on.

  SCREEN (one body of evidence, and it is burned for these purposes once scored). The 51 checkpoints already harvested under iteration 4's harvest/, the 24 graded in-house pairs, and the 32 previously graded checkpoints. Families I and II need one extra intervention pass per checkpoint, restricted to <= 2.2B for the screen plus the Qwen3-4B quartet. Outcomes available here: harmful compliance, over-refusal, safe engagement.

  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION (never touched by the screen; used once; no re-screening, and a failure kills the candidate rather than starting a subgroup search). Three parts: (a) at least 20 NEW checkpoints from at least 6 families never loaded in any iteration, all <= 4B, graded BEFORE any internal score is read; (b) the never-loaded 54-scenario XSTest split as the over-refusal substrate, and the 2 sealed families with their DISCLOSED_UPSTREAM status stated; (c) a FRESH in-house no-op and effective set built on a new parent family, in which every no-op must be capable in principle of moving BOTH readout classes -- head-only unembedding edits and system-prompt swaps are retained but flagged STRUCTURALLY DEGENERATE and excluded from the headline denominator.

  SELECTION RULE, fixed and hashed before scoring, and written in units that are attainable.
   (i) NON-COLLINEARITY PRE-SCREEN, applied BEFORE any outcome is read: a candidate whose |Spearman| with BL1_easy across the screen panel is
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
 >= 0.5 is DROPPED. This is the one rule that prevents a fifth repetition of the same null, and the count dropped is reported as the test of P1.
   (ii) PREDICTION, primary: on the confirmation panel, Spearman with OVER-REFUSAL whose paired bootstrap CI on |rho| - |rho_BL1| and on |rho| - |rho_AMS| excludes zero, plus a partial rho with over-refusal given BL1 and AMS that excludes zero.
   (iii) CO-PRIMARY: the same margin against harmful compliance, reported whether or not it passes, and the edit-robustness column (how much of a parent's safety survives a fixed in-house rank-one lesion at matched damage), where redundancy is predicted to win by mechanism.
   (iv) FALSE ALARMS, in attainable units: an exact McNemar test on paired false-alarm counts against BL1_easy over the non-degenerate no-op subset only, with the median null-SD displacement printed beside it. No null-SD gap bar.
   (v) SENSITIVITY: at least 7 of 9 effective pairs in the registered direction, INCLUDING AMD base -> SFT, which every activation readout currently misses.
   (vi) It must beat the card/name regex and the greedy refusal-text bar on at least one axis where those are structurally blind, or the abstract concedes that a text bar matches it.
   (vii) It escapes the shuffled-label band and the matched-norm random-direction control and is off ceiling in every arm.
   Ties go to fewer prompts. Every row prints its MDE, the k-curve over k in {0,4,8,16,32}, the expected sign and the observed sign, with no maximum over a scan.

  THE COMMISSIONED DELIVERABLE IS RESTORED TO FIRST CLASS. The four-way Qwen3-4B activation comparison -- Base, instruct, SafeRL, mlabonne-abliterated -- gets its own results section and its own figure, with the STaR non-safety fine-tune as the control row. BASE IS RESTORED TO THE INTERVENTION GRID, which iteration 4 omitted; a redundancy scalar is undefined in a model with nothing to be redundant about, and that is the prediction, not an excuse for leaving it out. Every table labels BL1_easy, BL1_hard and BL1_truelogit separately with the instruct/SafeRL ordering flip disclosed, prints AMS sigma at batch 1 and batch 8 (the released CLI's padding bug shifts Falcon3 by 5 sigma), and reconciles the two over-refusal measurements by naming the benign set in the column header.

  PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS, so the paper is positive either way. W2 and W3 order Base < instruct < SafeRL at equal level. W8 separates the abliterated child from its parent with the sign reversal already observed. W5 and W6 carry over-refusal information that BL1 cannot carry by construction. G2 is near zero for a blanket refuser. If instead every second-order candidate fails the (i) pre-screen, P1 wins and the deliverable is the bound: a single model's cheap activation readout has one coordinate, it is the request axis, AMS and the logit gap already read it, and the false-alarm and over-refusal audits say which of them to prefer. Both outcomes change what someone building a cheap safety metric would do next.

  REVIEWER MUST-FIXES CARRIED AS REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEXT PAPER. (1) A table of all 15 no-op and all 9 effective pairs by id with family, recipe, dHC and dOR with CIs and observed class, taken verbatim from classification.json; the abstract names the real categories (numerical precision x8, head-only unembedding x3, system-prompt x2, DPO x1, rank-one lesion alpha 0.5 x1), states that re-saves were excluded as trivially zero and that all three LoRA arms failed to be no-ops. (2) Every structurally degenerate cell is daggered and two headline numbers are given, 15-pair and 12-pair. (3) All 32 candidates are printed with readout class, false-alarm ids, sensitivity and median null-SD displacement, and the scatter plots all 32 with one marker per class; the caption states the true activation range 0-3 of 15; the card regex and greedy refusal bar are printed and discussed; the B7 row uses one variant consistently.

  FIELD-NORM REQUIREMENTS, taken from the mechanistic-interpretability handbook and binding on every candidate above.
   (A) THE DISSOCIATION IS A PREMISE WITH A FIELD NAME, NOT A FINDING. What iteration 4 observed at site resolution is the KNOWLEDGE-ACTION GAP (Basu 2603.18353: probes at 98.2% AUROC against 45.1% output sensitivity, a 53-point gap, with SAE steering indistinguishable from random perturbation). The handbook lists it as an OPEN question and explicitly wants a replication outside its single clinical domain with the same four-method comparison. Iteration 5 is positioned as exactly that replication in the safety-refusal domain, and the gap is cited, never claimed.
   (B) DECODABILITY IS NOT ACTIONABILITY, AND THE CLOSING TEST IS NAMED. Any claim that a write-handle scalar means the model can be corrected must report output-level correction AND collateral disruption on already-correct cases against a random-perturbation control. Iteration 4 already carries the collateral half (ARC flips 0/61, GSM8K unchanged); iteration 5 keeps both halves for every intervention candidate or states the claim as readout-only.
   (C) STABILITY, NOT POINT ESTIMATES. Directional and circuit-level quantities are known to swing under small changes of prompts, seeds and hyperparameters, so every candidate is reported as a DISTRIBUTION over prompt draws, direction-fit seeds and band boundaries, with the per-sample effect distribution and the failure regime printed beside any mean. A candidate whose sign is not stable across those draws is reported as unstable, not as an effect.
   (D) BASELINE FLOOR FOR ANY DIRECTION-BASED UNIT: difference-in-means and a prompting ceiling are reported beside every candidate, in addition to BL1 and AMS sigma.
   (E) NO SAE SUBSTRATE and no framing of W1-W4 as a new circuit-discovery method: sparse-dictionary decomposition and circuit discovery are the two most-worked lanes in the field, and the candidates here are raw-activation directional quantities that must stay outside both.
   (F) MAP-SILENCE IS NOT OPEN. Redundancy and distributedness as a PER-CHECKPOINT scalar, and self-repair as a per-checkpoint coefficient, are absent from the handbook's map, and the handbook's own base rate for unchecked lanes is 11 of 11 occupied. Iteration 5 therefore owes a fresh, dated saturation search on both BEFORE either is claimed as novel, and the research lane runs it first so a closure lands before the experiment is written

up, not after.

  PRIOR-ART FENCES. MUST NOT claim: a first cross-family few-prompt activation metric (AMS); a first internal scoring of abliterated checkpoints; reference-free or <=16 prompts as novelty; recognition/execution naming (Orgad 2604.09544, 2603.05773); recognition surviving abliteration; any weights-only statistic (Jorak, OBLITERATUS, the 273-checkpoint audit); a first decode-site readout (2609.18471); a first readout-under-quantisation or benign-fine-tune false-positive rate (Duan, Hurtado); a first logit-versus-activation comparison; a first random-direction control; or the read-versus-write dissociation itself, which Basu 2603.18353 and Galeone 2606.24952 own at the model level and which is used here as a premise, not a finding. Self-repair and backup behaviour under ablation are established in the circuits literature and W4 is positioned as a per-checkpoint scalarisation of a known phenomenon, never as its discovery. Activation steering and its reliability diagnostics are a crowded lane, so no candidate is presented as a new steering method and the per-sample unreliability of steering is cited rather than rediscovered. The knowledge-action gap itself is Basu's, and redundancy-as-a-per-checkpoint-scalar may not be called novel until the fresh saturation search in (F) returns. The claimed empty cell is narrow and checkable: a per-checkpoint INTERVENTION-RESPONSE and REDUNDANCY score for an arbitrary single checkpoint, registered on OVER-REFUSAL, audited for false alarms on behaviourally graded no-ops, and reported beside both the logit gap and AMS sigma.
motivation: |-
  1. THE MEASUREMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROPERTY AND AN AVERAGE, AND THAT IS THE PART THAT
  CHANGES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. If A is large, the response-site effect the literature reports is an
  average over a request factor nobody varied. It is then not a per-model property at all but a property
  of the model crossed with the harmful-request setting it was measured in. Two checkpoints with
  identical published response-site effects can behave completely differently the moment the request
  stops looking dangerous -- which is the regime that matters in long generations, multi-turn use and
  agentic tool loops, where the hazardous text a model is continuing was often not requested by anybody.
  This claim is publishable whichever way the checkpoints fall, and it costs 1,280 forward passes to
  settle for a given model.

  2. THE MISRANKING THE METRIC IS MEANT TO FIX IS DOCUMENTED, NOT ASSUMED. Internal harmfulness scores
  read at prompt-dependent locations have been reported to ANTI-rank successful jailbreaks, at AUROC
  0.220 among wrapped harmful prompts, meaning successful attacks rank LOWER than failed ones. That is
  independent published evidence that the standard cheap readout measures the wrong thing. The
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL card is the clean instance: in NON-THINK mode its safety rate rises 64.7 to 98.1 on
  WildGuard while its refusal rate FALLS 12.9 to 5.3, and on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge the same rows
  read 47.5 to 86.5. Both columns are quoted deliberately: 98.1 is near ceiling so the WildGuard column
  overstates headroom, and in THINK mode refusal barely moves, 6.5 to 6.2, so the argument that SafeRL
  cannot buy safety by refusing at token one is scoped to the non-think setting this study runs in.
  Every cheap readout in use -- first-token refusal probability, refusal-direction projection at the last
  prompt token, activation cluster separation, refusal rate -- reads the request-side gate, which is
  exactly the component this kind of training turns down.

  3. THE PRACTICAL ADVICE IS ALREADY PROVEN AND IS NOT CLAIMED; THE MECHANISM IS WHAT IS MISSING. A
  published defence trains on justify-then-refuse responses that distribute the refusal signal across
  token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under abliteration against 70 to 80
  point drops for baselines, with a feature-space section showing the edit shrinking the harmful-versus-
  benign PROMPT centroid distance far less in those

models, 10.0 / 7.7 / 13.7 against 28.8 / 33.9 / 28.7.
  So "put safety where a prompt-fitted rank-one edit cannot see" is known, and that paper measures the
  request axis at the prompt in models built to resist. What is missing is a measurement at RESPONSE
  positions that separates the request-gated part from the request-independent part, and a checkpoint
  that was not designed to resist. The claim is that the mechanism is the arming term, and that a model
  trained for something else entirely -- safe completion -- shows the same protective structure with
  nobody having built it in. Those same numbers are also why the surviving-monitor comparison is made at
  matched request-axis damage.
assumptions:
- >-
  The internal safety signal is linearly readable at generated positions and not only at the decision token. This is established
  rather than assumed: streaming hidden-state moderation probes decode the harmfulness of a partially written response throughout
  generation, and arXiv:2607.14147 reads the harm direction at response positions with a causal effect. The readout used here
  is a difference-in-means axis fitted on a DISJOINT corpus of hazardous versus benign continuations at response positions,
  benchmarked against a cross-validated linear probe and against raw hidden vectors, with the cross-fitted variant over the
  evaluation items retained as a robustness row.
- >-
  The response-content harm axis is not collinear with the direction abliteration removes. This is the load-bearing instrument
  assumption and it is measured rather than asserted: r_content is fitted at RESPONSE positions on a continuation contrast
  under a held-fixed request, where the abliteration direction is fitted at the last PROMPT token on a request contrast, and
  |cos| between them is a pre-registered Stage-2 gate at 0.50 backed by a component-preservation diagnostic. If the gate fails,
  the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue and are reported as one, with the arm carried by the per-checkpoint
  refit and the full probe. Two further measurement facts sit in the same assumption. Standard abliteration edits only matrices
  that write to the residual stream, using a direction estimated at prompt positions, which is what makes the headline a structural
  prediction rather than a guess; recipes that fit at response positions or re-train after editing would break it and are
  analysed as a separate stratum, never pooled. And cross-checkpoint terms are only comparable after standardisation, because
  residual-stream norms and LayerNorm gains differ between base, instruct, RL-tuned and weight-edited checkpoints and move
  again under the edit, so every cross-checkpoint quantity is expressed in that checkpoint's own measured null-band per-item
  SD with the raw-scale table published alongside.
- >-
  The request factor and the response factor can be varied independently over the same strings, so the interaction is estimable.
  Four cells share one continuation vocabulary and one token span. The threat is that the off-diagonal cells are incoherent
  continuations while the diagonals are coherent, loading a generic instruction-mismatch signal onto exactly the term the
  headline is stated in. This is neither assumed away nor handled by a constant subtraction: a safety-irrelevant crossed control
  of the same shape estimates the coherence interaction, both crossings are calibrated on the model's own log-probability
  of the prefix given the request, and where the mismatch magnitudes do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty
  and the arming term reported net of the covariate, or as an upper bound if the control's mismatch cannot be raised to the
  treatment's.
- >-
  A response-conditioned safety signal is not the same thing as generic autoregressive conditioning, and the two are separable
  by their dependence on the request and by whether they steer. Generic conditioning should produce a response main effect
  with no request modulation. This is the load-bearing scientific assumption behind treating A rat

her than CB as the safety
  term, and it is tested by two pre-registered non-safety arms -- Qwen3-4B-Base and a non-safety fine-tune of the same parent
  -- plus the causal requirement that the component be a write-handle and not merely readable.
- >-
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL's safety-up, refusal-down profile reflects a genuine safe-completion policy rather than a fixed hedging
  template that keyword refusal detectors miss. A quantitative template-collapse diagnostic runs before the second supporting
  prediction is interpreted: distinct-3-gram rate of SafeRL non-refusals at least 0.6 times that of Qwen3-4B non-refusals,
  and cross-request response similarity at least 0.15 below within-request similarity, both thresholds fixed before the run.

  OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS. A planner should be able to build Stage 0 and Stage 1 from this block alone.

  CHECKPOINTS, all verified live and ungated on 2026-09-20, all Qwen3, 36 layers, hidden size 2560, one
  tokenizer, so layer, head and token position are directly comparable with no alignment step. Each is
  loaded alone on the 20 GB card.

    Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL                   safe-completion arm; 8.04 GB; its card declares

                                           is recorded as a stated deviation from the other arms
    non-safety fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base  non-safety arm 2; ladder below
    + in-house edited grid: 5 strengths x {Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL}
    NOT USED: huihui-ai/Qwen3-4B-abliterated, whose repo is gated 'auto' and whose config cannot be read
    without authentication; mlabonne is the ungated community arm.

  NON-SAFETY FINE-TUNE LADDER, in order, fixed now so the arm cannot be chosen after Base is seen:
    (1) an ungated, non-quantised third-party fine-tune whose parent is DECLARED as Qwen3-4B-Base in the
        repo metadata, not merely implied by its name, and which ships the stock Qwen chat template so
        that token spans match the other arms exactly. Verified live on 2026-09-20 and ordered by those
        two criteria: CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.03.01_1e-6 first, a hint-generation SFT run with
        an explicit base_model tag and the stock 4,116-byte Qwen template; then
        CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.04.00_1e-6_no_think, same family; then
        shjondhale/AzureML-Qwen3-4B-Base-GRPO, a math GRPO run with an explicit base_model tag but a
        custom 1,991-byte template, which costs span comparability and is therefore ranked below the
        first two. HikariLight/Qwen3_4B_Base__COMP_ACI_DAMT_SFT_Merged is live and ungated and carries
        the stock template, but its repo declares no base_model at all, so its parentage rests on its
        name; it is a last resort within this rung and would be reported with that caveat.
    (2) failing all three, an in-house LoRA or short full fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base on an ungated
        non-safety instruction set -- hours of GPU time at 4B, and it holds parent, tokenizer and
        template exactly fixed, which the cross-family option does not;
    (3) only failing both, a non-safety fine-tune of another family's parent, and then only under the
        standardized null-SD units.
    Any third-party fine-tune differs from the instruct checkpoint in instruction-following ability and
    in chat template as well as in safety training; that is a stated confound, the arm's chat template is

ported next to its results, and it is why rung (2) is preferred over rung (3).

  READOUT DIRECTION r_content, stated completely because this is what decides whether Stage 2 measures
  anything: difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATION tokens, taken at RESPONSE
  positions, over a fitting corpus of 64 continuation pairs written under a single held-fixed, neutral
  request, disjoint from the 96 evaluation scenarios. It is therefore a different vector from the
  abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the
  last PROMPT token. A fully disjoint fitting corpus is stronger than cross-fitting over the evaluation
  items, not weaker: it removes in-sample selection entirely rather than rotating it, and the
  cross-fitted variant over the 96 scenarios is retained as a robustness row.

  LAYER BAND: a contiguous band of 25% of the network's layers (9 of 36), expressed as a FRACTION OF
  NETWORK DEPTH so it transfers to any architecture, chosen at Stage 0 as the band maximising the continuation-contrast
  positive control in Qwen3-4B, computed on the FITTING CORPUS ONLY and never on the evaluation
  scenarios, then frozen for all checkpoints. Secondary, pre-registered: a per-checkpoint BEST-BAND
  search, Holm-corrected, against which the safety-specificity gate must also hold.

  RESPONSE-POSITION WINDOWS: continuation tokens 5-20 (EARLY, primary) and 40-55 (LATE), both read from
  one forward pass over a continuation of at least 64 tokens, so the position curve costs nothing.

  ITEMS: 96 confirmatory scenarios plus a 54-scenario HELD-OUT REPLICATION set, split at random before
  any activations are collected. The supply was checked rather than assumed: XSTest v2 ships 450 prompts,
  250 safe across 10 types and 200 unsafe contrast across 8 types, and in 6 of those contrast families --
  homonyms, safe targets, safe contexts, definitions, figurative language and historical events -- the
  safe and unsafe rows are genuine minimal-edit twins, 25 each, giving 150 tightly matched pairs. The
  remaining two contrast families, discrimination and privacy, are only topically parallel and are
  excluded. So 96 is a power-driven choice out of 150 available pairs and the leftover 54 become a real
  replication set rather than a subsample; OR-Bench (80,359 / 1,319 / 655 rows across its three configs)
  is available if a domain needs topping up. Two prefix families per scenario, generated mechanically
  from two fixed templates: F1 ANNOUNCED, where the continuation opens by naming what it is about to do,
  and F2 ENACTED, where it simply performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement.

  FORWARD-PASS BUDGET: 96 items x (4 safety cells x 2 families + 4 coherence cells) + 128 fitting-corpus
  passes = 1,280 per model state; 15 model states = 19,200 passes. The 54-item held-out replication runs
  on the five checkpoints only, adding 3,240. Total about 22,400 forward passes of at most 320 tokens
  with zero generated tokens: minutes to low tens of minutes of GPU time, which is why the item count is
  set by power and not by compute.

  REFUSAL DRIVE, the dependent variable of the causal arm and of the CB half of the specificity gate,
  defined here because a gate cannot be evaluated against an undefined outcome. PRIMARY: the teacher-
  forced probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the
  intervened span. It is well defined in Base, needs no decision label, and is the quantity the published
  0.24-versus-0.03 routing-concentration figure speaks to. SECONDARY: the cross-validated full-probe
  decision score, trained on Qwen3-4B and applied unchanged to Base, with that transfer flagged. Both are
  output-side READOUTS of an activation-side INTERVENTION, which is what the commissioned invariant
  permits; the deployed metric itself stays activation-only and never uses them.

  EDIT-STRENGTH GRID: five strengths per lineage, spanning zero to the strength at which O collapses,
  with the primary comparison read

off each lineage's own O-damage curve by interpolation.

  STAGE 0 -- INSTRUMENT, ITEMS AND GATES, ALL BEFORE ANY EXPENSIVE WORK.
  Build the 64-pair fitting corpus and fit r_content. Check split-half cosine >= 0.70 in every
  checkpoint; below it, the fitting corpus is enlarged before Stage 1 rather than after effects are seen.
  RUN THE POWER CHECK HERE TOO, not only the direction check: on a 24-item pilot subset, estimate r, the
  ratio of the per-item SD of A to the per-item null SD, and recompute the MDE for every row of the
  criteria table at the planned n. If the achieved r implies an MDE above any registered threshold, the
  scenario count is raised toward the 150 available pairs BEFORE the confirmatory run, and the pilot items
  are excluded from the held-out set. The escape hatch is conditional on this check and on the split-half
  cosine, and the achieved r is reported either way, so a reader can see what the design could and could
  not have detected.
  Choose the layer band on fitting-corpus data only and freeze it as a fraction of network depth. Build 96 twin
  scenarios from XSTest's safe split topped up from OR-Bench, and generate both prefix families
  mechanically from two fixed templates, publishing all cells verbatim. Gates: (a) an external judge
  labels twins and prefixes correctly at a stated rate; (b) a positive control that r_content separates
  hazardous from benign continuations in Qwen3-4B; (c) a PLACEBO prefix factor at the same lexical
  distance, tested for equivalence within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST, whose attainability is shown above;
  (d) null bands from at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the ENTIRE
  pipeline including the direction fit, which is also what defines the null-SD unit; (e) the NLL-MATCH
  DIAGNOSTIC described next.

  THE COHERENCE CONTROL IS CALIBRATED, NOT ASSUMED. Subtracting the coherence interaction from the safety
  interaction is only valid if the generic instruction-mismatch signal enters additively and if the two
  crossings produce mismatches of comparable magnitude -- and a benign request followed by an off-topic
  benign prefix is a mild non-sequitur where a benign request followed by a hazardous prefix is a severe
  one. The calibration costs nothing because it comes from the same forward passes: the model's own mean
  token log-probability of the PREFIX given the REQUEST. The four-cell log-probability table is reported
  for BOTH 2x2s as a mandatory Stage-0 diagnostic, and the off-diagonal penalty in the coherence crossing
  must be statistically indistinguishable from, or larger than, the penalty in the safety crossing before
  any subtraction is performed. If they do not match, nothing constant is subtracted: the per-item
  readout is regressed on the per-item log-probability penalty across all cells and A_net is reported as
  the coefficient net of that covariate, which survives both a magnitude mismatch and mild
  non-additivity. If the coherence penalty cannot be brought up to the safety penalty at all, A_net is
  reported as an UPPER BOUND on arming rather than as an estimate, and labelled that way everywhere.

  STAGE 1 IS THE COMMISSIONED DELIVERABLE: THE ACTIVATION-LEVEL COMPARISON. Five checkpoints, each loaded
  alone on the 20 GB card, with the F32 community checkpoint cast to bf16 on load and that cast recorded
  as a stated deviation. The 54-scenario held-out set is run here too, on these five only, and its
  estimates are sealed until the confirmatory analysis is complete. For every layer and every position in the frozen window, produce maps of O, CB
  and A in all five, with item-clustered bootstrap intervals and per-item distributions rather than means
  alone, in both raw and null-SD units, under BOTH prefix families and BOTH response-position windows. The base
  protocol is stated rather than left to formatting: Base is run twice, once with the Qwen3-4B chat
  template applied verbatim so token spans match across checkpoints and once in plain completion format,
  and the two must agree qualitatively before
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
 Base is used as a control, because alignment is reported to
  concentrate in the assistant header tokens and those tokens are out of distribution for Base.
  The RESPONSE-POSITION curve, A in the early window against A in the late window, is reported as a
  result in its own right: it separates an arming term that persists from a shallow-alignment transient
  at one position, which a single frozen window cannot do, and it is free because both windows come from
  the same forward pass.

  THE CAUSAL ARM USES THE RUNG THAT SURVIVES. Not full-residual patching: that restores refusal to 100
  percent at every layer, but so does patching the mean BENIGN residual at the same position, so the
  intervention is generic disruption and a random-direction control cannot detect the failure because the
  benign patch is the treatment. Instead add or remove ONLY the r_content component at response
  positions, at layer cells fixed at Stage 0, against a matched-norm control direction ORTHOGONALIZED to
  it, with full-residual patching retained and labelled as a positive control that the intervention did
  something. Report collateral disruption on already-correct benign cases and the per-item effect
  distribution, never a mean at one coefficient.

  STAGE 2 BUILDS THE MISSING CHECKPOINT AND TESTS THE HEADLINE. No abliterated safe-completion model
  exists, so one pinned rank-one orthogonalisation with the direction estimated at prompt positions is
  applied to BOTH Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-4B-SafeRL across a five-strength grid. Minutes of GPU time, no
  training, recipe held fixed, so a difference between lineages is attributable to safety-training style
  rather than to the tool -- the confound that wrecks comparisons across harvested community checkpoints.
  Stage 2 measures each lineage's O-damage curve first, then makes the primary comparison at the
  pre-registered matched-damage level by interpolation. The annihilation gate and the
  component-preservation diagnostic are evaluated here, before any term is interpreted. The harvested
  public abliteration is an external check that the in-house edit reproduces a real one, and each
  lineage's pre-edit A is recorded before the edit so post-edit survival is a forecast, not a fit.

  STAGE 3 COLLECTS BEHAVIOURAL GROUND TRUTH ON BOTH COLUMNS. For the five checkpoints, the in-house
  edits, and a panel of ungated checkpoints at or below 4B spanning at least SIX families -- families,
  not checkpoints, are the clustering unit -- measure harmful-compliance rate, over-refusal on hard
  benign twins, and safe-engagement rate, graded by a fixed rubric through an OpenRouter judge. Budget
  planned before the sweep at roughly 4,000 to 6,000 graded responses, near 3 to 5 US dollars against the
  10 dollar cap, with the running total checked after every batch and the sweep stopped on approach.

  STAGE 4 ASKS WHETHER THE PROFILE PREDICTS ANYTHING, ON TWO CO-PRIMARY COLUMNS AND AT FIVE PROMPT
  BUDGETS. Leave-one-family-out prediction with no recalibration, of harmful-compliance rate and of
  safe-engagement rate, from (O, CB, A), against baselines prior work says are hard to beat: the
  model-card and repository-name regex, black-box greedy refusal rate, first-token refusal logit gap,
  activation cluster separation, raw hidden vectors as the non-featurized control, and -- added because it
  is the only published family competing on the same axis -- a NON-GENERATIVE LATENT SAFETY EVALUATOR from
  the recent line that scores safety from a checkpoint's latent representations without sampling any text.
  Where such a method has a usable implementation it is run on the same panel; where it does not, its
  reported numbers on any overlapping checkpoints are tabulated beside ours and the comparison is labelled
  indirect. Those methods read the request side and return a scalar, so the claim here is specifically
  that a profile separating the request term from the unconditional response term and their interaction
  beats a scalar on the safe-engagement column, which is exactly where a request-side scalar 
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
should fail.
  The decision rule
  is fixed so a coin cannot pass it: the profile must beat the STRONGEST baseline on at least 5 of 6
  families, which a fair coin passes 10.9 percent of the time where a bare majority of six passes 34
  percent, AND the paired family-clustered interval must exclude zero. The same evaluation is repeated at
  k = 4, 8, 16, 32 and 96 quadruples and the smallest k that still passes is reported as the headline
  prompt budget. Both outcomes are informative: if the profile fails to transfer, Stages 1 and 2 stand as
  a mechanism result on the commissioned trio and the failure localises which term refuses to generalise.

  RELEASED ARTEFACTS, because the coordinate is only reusable if the stimuli are: all 768 safety cells
  (96 scenarios x 4 cells x 2 families), all 384 coherence cells, the 128-text fitting battery, the
  fitted directions, the per-item four-cell scalars and the full layer-by-position maps for every
  checkpoint. The nearest existing artefact collects answer-position activations for the same trio but is
  gated, has no counterfactual factor and carries no analysis, so an ungated crossed one is an
  independent contribution.

  tokens, minutes to low tens of minutes; Stage 2 is a rank-one weight edit. The binding costs are panel
  downloads, streamed one checkpoint at a time, and the Stage 3 judge calls, budgeted above.
success_criteria: |-
  CRITERIA TABLE. Every threshold is a NUMBER, in null-SD units, fixed now. Planning arithmetic, shown
  once and used for every row: the null-SD unit is the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast
  computed under >=20 random unit directions in that checkpoint, so it is n-independent and carries that
  checkpoint's own residual-stream scale. The standard error of a standardized term is r/sqrt(n) where
  r = (per-item SD of the real term)/(per-item null SD); we plan at r = 1.2 and n = 96 scenarios, giving
  SE = 0.123, and report the achieved r. Derived MDEs at n=96: simple term 0.24; two-checkpoint
  difference 0.34; pre/post difference-in-differences 0.48; TOST half-width at 90% 0.20; coherence-net A
  0.25 to 0.34 depending on the covariate R-squared. At n=24 those same numbers are 0.48 / 0.68 / 0.96 /
  0.40, which is why 24 items was abandoned: the difference-in-differences that carries the headline would
  have had a minimum detectable effect of 0.96 null-SD, larger than any margin worth setting. The item
  count is therefore set by this arithmetic and not by what the twin sets happen to yield -- 150 matched
  XSTest pairs exist, 96 are used for the confirmatory analysis and the remaining 54 become a held-out
  replication set whose own two-checkpoint MDE is 0.45.

  CONFIRMS the hypothesis. Every threshold is the NUMBER in the criteria table; nulls are measured from
  at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the whole pipeline including the
  direction fit, never from a nominal chance value.
  - SAFETY-SPECIFICITY GATE, which must pass before any term is called safety, registered PER CHECKPOINT
    before the run so no term is chosen after the fact: Qwen3-4B on A, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL on CB. Each must
    exceed BOTH non-safety arms on its registered term by 0.50 null-SD with item-clustered intervals
    excluding zero, in the frozen band AND against each non-safety arm's Holm-corrected BEST band, so a
    null in a non-safety arm that disappears under the best-band search is reported as a band artefact
    rather than as specificity. Because a base model can carry a readable CB from generic autoregressive
    conditioning alone, the CB half additionally requires the CAUSAL arm: moving the r_content component
    at response positions must change the refusal drive in the safety-trained checkpoint and not in Base,
    against the orthogonalized control. A term that is readable but inert does not pass.
  - COHERENCE-NET ARMING: A_net exceeds 0.40 null-SD with an interval excluding zero in the checkpoint
    registered on A. This applies to A wherever A is claimed and nowhere else: SafeRL is predicted to have
    A near zero, so a null A_net there confirms P2 rather than failing this gate, and the two are
    distinguished by which term each checkpoint was registered on before the run.
  - TEMPLATE GENERA
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
LITY: the arming ordering holds under BOTH prefix families, announced and enacted. A
    result present only under the announced family is a property of the announcement, not of the content,
    and is reported as such.
  - ORDERING: A(Qwen3-4B) - A(SafeRL) > 0.50 null-SD and CB(SafeRL) - CB(Qwen3-4B) > 0.50 null-SD, paired,
    intervals excluding zero. The refusal-tuned model's output monitoring is armed by the request; the
    safe-completion model's runs unconditionally.
  - HEADLINE, at the matched-damage level and with no denominator anywhere: (i) post-edit A is equivalent
    to the null band within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST in BOTH lineages; (ii) post-edit CB exceeds 0.40
    null-SD in every lineage where it exceeded it before; (iii) the difference in differences on
    T = CB + A, the published response-site effect under a harmful request,
    [T_post-T_pre](SafeRL) - [T_post-T_pre](Qwen3-4B), exceeds 0.60 null-SD, paired and item-clustered.
    (iii) carries the claim, and it is stated as a CHANGE in T rather than as a level in CB for two
    separate reasons: a post-edit level comparison is entailed by the pre-edit gap plus (ii), and a
    change in CB has a floor in the very lineage P1 predicts to have little CB to lose. T is nonzero in
    both lineages by construction, so it has neither problem. Underneath it, 7b: writing drop_X = X_pre - X_post so that a
    positive drop means the term fell, then within the lineage whose A clears the null band before the
    edit, drop_A exceeds drop_CB by 0.35 null-SD in that checkpoint's own units; and 7c: the CB difference in differences, reported only where CB_pre clears the null band in
    both lineages and declared UNDEFINED otherwise rather than counted as a failure. If no pair of
    strengths gives matched O damage, the criterion fails and is reported unmet rather than relaxed.
  - FORECAST: the lineage with the smaller pre-edit A shows the smaller absolute change in T, with both
    change intervals excluding zero. This is what makes the pre-edit measurement predictive rather than
    descriptive, and it is registered as its own criterion rather than left in prose.
  - CAUSAL: at fixed layer cells, adding or removing the r_content component at response positions moves
    the refusal drive more than a matched-norm orthogonalized control, with the per-item distribution
    reported, and the size of that effect tracks CB across checkpoints.
  - DOUBLE DISSOCIATION, the strongest single form the result can take: safe-completion training raises
    CB and not A; the prompt-fitted weight edit lowers A and not CB, same recipe, both lineages. No single
    scalar of safety strength can produce that pattern, so if both halves hold with intervals excluding
    zero the two terms are separately real.
  - INSTRUMENT INTEGRITY: |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| at most 0.50 and the edited model's variance along
    r_content at least 0.25 times the median variance along 20 matched-norm random directions. If either
    fails, the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue, are labelled one, and the arm
    is reported only under refit and full-probe readouts.
  - STABILITY AND REPLICATION: every reported term carries its distribution over bootstrap resamples,
    at least three probe-set subsamples and both prefix families, and a term whose sign is not stable
    across those draws is reported as unstable rather than as an effect. Beyond resampling, the two
    ordering criteria and the coherence-net arming criterion are re-run once on the 54-scenario HELD-OUT
    set, which is split off before any activations are collected; the ordering must hold there in sign,
    with the held-out estimate reported whether or not it does.
  - METRIC PAYOFF: under leave-one-family-out with no recalibration, (O, CB, A) beats the strongest
    baseline on at least 5 of 6 families with a paired family-clustered interval excluding zero, on BOTH
    co-primary columns or on safe-engagement with an honest report of the harmful-compliance result either
    way; and the prompt-budget curv

  DISCONFIRMS it, stated so the run cannot be rescued afterwards.
  - THE CHEAPEST KILL, checked at Stage 1 before any judge spend: if A is inside the null band in EVERY
    checkpoint, the arming coordinate is empty, output monitoring where it exists is unconditional, and
    the headline is dead. The run then reports a single response-site term, says plainly that
    arXiv:2607.14147 already owns it, and reports the methodological claim as refuted for this family --
    which is itself the answer to the question asked, not a rebranding.
  - If A and CB are BOTH inside the null band everywhere there is no response-site signal in this family
    under this readout, which would contradict published work and is first treated as instrument failure.
  - If A is as large in Base or in the non-safety fine-tune as in the safety-trained checkpoints, A is a
    fact about autoregressive conditioning, not about safety, and the interpretation is withdrawn.
  - If the NLL-match gate fails and the covariate regression still leaves the safety interaction fully
    explained by the mismatch penalty, the headline term is instruction-mismatch and is reported as such.
  - If CB is readable but r_content is not a write-handle in any safety-trained checkpoint, the monitor
    reading is withdrawn: what was measured is a content representation, the correlational maps stand, the
    causal claim does not.
  - If SafeRL's A is at or above Qwen3-4B's, or its CB at or below, the training-objective argument behind
    P2 is wrong. That is a real finding about safe-completion training and is reported as a refutation.
  - If the edit drives CB into the null band as well as A, or if the T difference in differences comes
    back null or reversed at matched damage, the blind-spot argument is wrong: the two terms share a write
    bottleneck and a prompt-estimated rank-one edit reaches both. If it leaves A above the
    null band, the request-axis fitting argument is wrong in the other direction.
  - If the annihilation gate fails -- |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| above 0.50, or the edited model's variance
    along r_content at floor against the random-direction reference -- then the parent-fixed post-edit
    numbers measure a deleted coordinate rather than a model property, and the Stage-2 headline is
    WITHDRAWN under that basis rather than reported. The arm then carries only what the per-checkpoint
    refit and the full probe support, and if those disagree the honest output is that this design cannot
    settle post-edit survival, which is a stated limit rather than a softened claim. Stages 1 and 3 are
    unaffected, because neither depends on the edited checkpoints.
  - If the arming ordering holds under one prefix family and reverses under the other, A is a property of
    that template and is reported as a template effect, not a checkpoint property.
  - If the template-collapse diagnostic fires, P2 is uninterpretable and must be restated about templates
    rather than controllers.
  - REPORTING RULE, stated once. Every pass-or-fail test takes one of four permitted forms: an absolute
    main effect; the same term compared across two checkpoints; a change in one term, or a difference of
    such changes across checkpoints; or, in exactly one place, a difference between the CHANGES in two
    different terms INSIDE one checkpoint (criterion 7b), which is permitted because both changes are
    expressed in that one checkpoint's own null-SD units and no scale travels between models. None is a
    ratio between two different main effects and none is a share. The descriptive arming fraction A/(CB+A) is reported only where CB+A clears the
    null band, is labelled UNDEFINED elsewhere, and never decides anything. No statistic in this design is
    computable only when the hypothesis is true, and each disconfirming outcome names a quantity that is
    well defined in the world where the hypothesis fails. Equivalence claims use two one-sided tests with
    the margins above, whos

  arXiv:2607.14147, Kwon, 'Breaking Refusal in the First Half: A Mechanistic Study of the Prefill Jailbreak' (14 Jul 2026)
  -- THE NEAREST PRIOR WORK and the constraint this design is built around. It holds the request harmful, varies the content
  of the model's own response, reads the harm direction at response positions and concludes that refusal is 'a shallow, response-site
  computation'. That pathway is conceded entirely and is not claimed here. Its pre-registered 2x2 is harm x SURFACE trigger
  density (AdvBench-scary/clean x XSTest-safe/Alpaca) run in the plain condition, never crossed with the prefill factor, and
  it contains no benign-twin construction; the nearest thing to the arming term is a 24-prompt specificity control inside
  one intervention arm, a behavioural difference-in-differences of +16.8 points (harmful refusal 3 to 24 percent, benign 0
  to 4 percent) reported as a check that an attention knockout was harm-specific -- behavioural rather than activation-level,
  unmatched rather than twinned, attached to an intervention rather than to a readout. It produces no per-checkpoint summary
  and contains no abliterated, weight-edited, safe-completion or safety-RL checkpoint; its panel is Qwen2.5-0.5B to 7B, SmolLM2-1.7B,
  Phi-3-mini-3.8B and Phi-3-medium-14B with Qwen2.5 base controls. Three of its findings are adopted rather than rediscovered:
  the full-residual patch is dropped because the benign-residual control also returns refusal to 100 percent at every layer;
  the single refusal direction is demoted because the diff-of-means readout ceilings at AUC 0.727 while a full probe reads
  about 0.85, with SmolLM2 a single-direction counterexample; and its base-model result is treated as the central threat,
  including the detail that most supports this design -- the instruct model routes the same signal to refusal tokens about
  8 times more than the base model does, concentration 0.24 against 0.03, which is exactly the readable-but-inert versus write-handle
  distinction the causal gate is built on.

  responses that distribute the refusal signal across token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under
  abliteration against 70 to 80 point drops for baselines. It owns the practical recommendation, which is why that recommendation
  is not claimed as new. It is not purely behavioural: its feature-space section runs PCA on final hidden states of harmful
  and benign PROMPTS and reports abliteration shrinking the centroid distance by 28.8, 33.9 and 28.7 points in standard models
  against 10.0, 7.7 and 13.7 in extended-refusal models. That is a REQUEST-axis measurement at the prompt, with no response-position
  readout, no decomposition into request and response terms and no causal intervention -- and it is the direct source of the
  matched-damage requirement in this design, since it shows the edit is globally less effective on such models. The remaining
  contribution here is the mechanism, small arming plus an unconditional monitor, and the prediction that a checkpoint trained
  for safe completion shows the same protective structure although nobody built it in, which a deliberately constructed defence
  cannot demonstrate.

se-autoencoder feature steering produced zero corrections and zero disruptions, identical to its random-feature
  control, and concept-bottleneck steering was indistinguishable from random perturbation. That is why the safety-specificity
  gate here is stated on the CAUSAL arm and never on the readout alone: a readable component is not a write-handle. The scope
  caveat is stated rather than hidden -- one clinical triage domain, 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes, two models -- so
  it motivates the gate without being treated as a universal law.

  is the closest work on deciding mid-generation that something has gone wrong, but its safety results come from an EXTERNAL
  scorer rather than from the generating model's own hidden states; the internal-signal ablation uses token log-probabilities

  the arming term is not reachable from it.

  in hidden space, making the model monitorable without an external module, evaluated on SALAD-Bench safety and XSTest over-refusal.
  It is the strongest statement that a model's own representations can be made to carry the safety signal, and it is also
  the clearest illustration of the gap this study addresses: the disentanglement is defined on the input QUERY's category,
  so it lives entirely on the request axis and never asks about hazardous content inside a response to a benign request.

  arXiv:2507.11878, 'LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately' -- the closest published two-direction decomposition
  of the safety signal, and the one a reader is most likely to mistake for this work. It separates a harmfulness direction
  from a refusal direction and shows they are distinct, which is independent support for treating the harm readout and the
  refusal outcome as different objects, as the causal arm here does. But it fits and reads BOTH directions at prompt-side
  positions, at the instruction token and just after it, and never touches activations over generated text. Its split is therefore
  between two things the model computes about the REQUEST; the split here is between what the request contributes, what the
  model's own output contributes, and whether the first gates the second.

  published statement of the misranking this hypothesis sets out to explain, cited as the grounding premise rather than as
  a competitor: it diagnoses the coordinate problem behaviourally and proposes a fixed coordinate, where this work decomposes
  the signal into a request term, an unconditional response term and their interaction.

  versus write-side dissociation, screened and abandoned as a mechanism for this run; they bound what the abliteration blind-spot

- >-
  The abliteration dimensionality debate (Arditi arXiv:2406.11717; Marshall and Belrose affine arXiv:2411.09003; Wollschlager
  cones arXiv:2502.17420; Winninger arXiv:2607.02396, which reports Qwen3-8B requiring at least three directions) -- these
  own the read-rank versus write-rank question, also screened and abandoned. They matter because they predict that a rank-one
  edit is an incomplete write-handle, which is why this design pre-registers the parent-fixed basis, publishes cos(r_parent,
  r_child), and adds the component-preservation diagnostic instead of assuming the edited model is measured in the same coordinates
  as its parent.
inspiration: |-
  The framing came from control engineering and the ESTIMAND came from epidemiology, and it is the second
  import that does the work.

  Control engineering supplies the vocabulary: a controller is open-loop when its action is computed once
  from the reference input, closed-loop when it is recomputed from the plant's own measured output. In an
  autoregressive model the plant output is literally the text already emitted, re-read at every step
  through self-attention, so the distinction is available rather than analogical. That framing alone was
  not enough, because the closed-loop pathway turned out to be published. A borrowed frame earns nothing
  if the thing it names has already been measured.

  What rescued it was effect modification, the epidemiologist's discipline about interactions.
  Epidemiology takes as basic that a treatment effect averaged over a modifier is not a property of the
  treatment, and that the interaction is often the scientifically interesting quantity rather than a
  nuisance to control away. Applied here that is an indictment: the published response-site effect is
  measured only under harmful requests, so it is an effect at one level of an unvaried modifier, and
  whether the request MODIFIES it has not been asked.
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
 That turns a missing cell into a real quantity --
  is the monitor armed or always on -- and it is the quantity the abliteration argument actually bears
  on, since an edit fitted on the request axis should remove a request-dependent gate and not a
  request-independent monitor. Epidemiology supplied the discipline that came with it too: an interaction
  is only interpretable against a control for whatever else distinguishes the off-diagonal cells, which
  is why the crossed non-safety control is part of the design rather than an afterthought -- and, in this
  revision, why that control is CALIBRATED on the model's own prefix log-probability before anything is
  subtracted, since an interaction control that produces a milder mismatch than the treatment cells
  under-subtracts by exactly the amount that would manufacture the headline.

  Two smaller imports remain. From experimental psychology, the factorial logic that separating two
  confounded causes requires varying each independently over the same materials: reading safety at one
  token position is a one-cell design and the fix is the other three cells. From reliability engineering,
  the observation that a two-barrier system fails as though it had one barrier when a single fault removes
  both, which is what made the fitting-set argument load-bearing rather than a curiosity. This revision
  adds a third, from measurement theory: a quantity is only comparable across instruments if it is
  expressed in units the instrument itself defines, which is why every cross-checkpoint term is now read
  in that checkpoint's own measured null-band scale instead of in raw residual-stream units.

  The negative screening mattered as much. Five mechanisms were built and abandoned in an earlier
  iteration because their core already exists: attention-side versus write-side dissociation, the
  read-rank versus write-rank funnel, mutational robustness of refusal under weight noise, a
  recognition-versus-enforcement two-axis profile, and a common-cause-failure concentration score. A
  sixth was abandoned next -- the bare closed-loop main effect, which arXiv:2607.14147 owns causally --
  and the question was kept by moving to the term that paper's design cannot reach.
terms:
- term: Published response-site effect (T)
  definition: >-
    T = CB + A = s_H,haz - s_H,ben: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text appears in the model's own
    output under a HARMFUL request. It is algebraically a simple difference, it is the quantity existing response-site work
    reports, and it is nonzero in every safety-trained checkpoint by construction. That last property is why the headline
    survival test is stated as a change in T: a change in CB alone would have a floor in the lineage predicted to have little
    CB to lose, and a post-edit level comparison would be entailed by the pre-edit gap.
- term: Arming (A)
  definition: >-
    The interaction term of the 2x2: how much MORE a model's internal safety signal reacts to hazardous text it has already
    written when the request was harmful than when the request was a matched benign twin. Large A means an output monitor
    the request switches on; A near zero means one that is always on. It is the headline quantity because it is the part of
    the response-conditioned signal that a base model's generic autoregressive conditioning does not predict.
- term: Unconditional output monitoring (CB)
  definition: >-
    The response main effect measured under the BENIGN request: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text
    appears in the model's own output although nothing in the request called for it. Never used alone as evidence of safety,
    because a non-safety-tuned model can have a nonzero CB from next-token statistics alone, which is why the CB half of the
    specificity gate requires the causal arm.
- term: Open-loop strength (O)
  definition: >-
    The request main effect: how much the internal safety signal differs between a harmful request and its matched benign
    twin, averaged over both

response prefixes. This is the component every standard cheap readout measures, and the component
    a prompt-fitted weight edit is fitted on. It is also the axis along which the two lineages are matched for edit damage
    before any survival comparison is made.
- term: Effect modification
  definition: >-
    The epidemiological name for a situation in which the effect of one factor depends on the level of another. Its methodological
    consequence is imported directly: where modification is present, a main effect averaged over the modifier is not a property
    of the system, so a response-site effect measured only under harmful requests cannot be read as a per-model property.
- term: Response-content harm axis (r_content)
  definition: >-
    The primary readout direction: a difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATIONS taken at RESPONSE token
    positions, under one held-fixed neutral request, on a fitting corpus disjoint from the evaluation items. It is deliberately
    a different vector from the abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS
    at the last PROMPT token. Their cosine is a pre-registered gate, because if the two coincided the weight edit would delete
    the measurement coordinate and every post-edit number would be an algebraic residue rather than a fact about safety.
- term: Null-SD unit
  definition: >-
    The unit every cross-checkpoint comparison is reported in: the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast computed
    under at least 20 random unit directions in that same checkpoint. It is independent of the item count and it carries that
    checkpoint's own residual-stream and LayerNorm scale, which raw projections do not, so it is what makes a term measured
    in a base model, an RL-tuned model and a weight-edited model the same quantity.
- term: Refusal drive
  definition: >-
    The dependent variable of the causal arm, and of the CB half of the safety-specificity gate. PRIMARY: the teacher-forced
    probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the intervened span, which is well
    defined in a base model and needs no decision label. SECONDARY: a cross-validated full-probe decision score trained on
    the instruct model and applied unchanged elsewhere. It is an output-side readout of an activation-side intervention; the
    deployed metric never uses it.
- term: Coherence control, and its calibration
  definition: >-
    A second 2x2 of the same shape over the same items in which a safety-irrelevant attribute is crossed the same way: a benign
    request about topic A or B, crossed with a benign prefix about topic A or B. It estimates the generic instruction-mismatch
    interaction that would otherwise be indistinguishable from arming. Subtracting it is only licensed if its mismatch is
    as severe as the safety crossing's, so the two are calibrated on the model's own mean log-probability of the prefix given
    the request, and where they do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty instead of having a constant subtracted.
- term: Prefix family
  definition: >-
    One of two structurally different templates from which every hazardous continuation is generated. ANNOUNCED opens by naming
    what it is about to do; ENACTED performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement. Both are run because
    a result present only under an explicit announcement is a property of the announcement rather than of the content.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A training-free edit that removes a model's ability to refuse. One refusal direction is estimated by difference of means
    over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the last prompt token, then orthogonalised out of every weight matrix that writes
    to the residual stream. Everything it is fitted on lives on the request axis, which is the structural basis of the headline
    prediction. Here it is used as a controlled manipulation for localising the signal, in the way a lesion localises a fun

ction.
- term: Matched request-axis damage
  definition: >-
    The condition under which two lineages are compared after editing: edit strengths chosen so that each lineage loses an
    equal amount of O, read off its own measured strength-to-damage curve by interpolation. Without it, a lineage on which
    the edit simply bites less would look protected.
- term: Safe completion
  definition: >-
    An alignment style in which a model answers a risky request at a safe level of detail instead of refusing. Qwen3-4B-SafeRL
    is an openly released model of this kind: in non-think mode its card reports safety rising 64.7 to 98.1 on WildGuard and
    47.5 to 86.5 on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge, while refusal falls 12.9 to 5.3; in think mode refusal barely moves, 6.5
    to 6.2.
- term: Safe-engagement rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of harmful requests a model answers without refusing and without emitting harmful content. A co-primary target
    alongside harmful-compliance rate because, unlike refusal rate, it penalises a blanket refuser, and no cheap internal
    safety metric has been validated against it.
- term: Parent-fixed versus refitted direction
  definition: >-
    Two readout conventions, each registered where it is correct. Parent-fixed, the parent's direction applied to the edited
    child, is the only convention under which 'the arming fell more than the monitor' is a statement within one basis, so
    it is primary for the edited arm, and the direction is carried over rather than refitted inside a fold. A per-checkpoint
    refit is what the DEPLOYED metric must use, since an arbitrary HuggingFace model has no parent.
- term: Teacher forcing
  definition: >-
    Running the model over a fixed, pre-written continuation instead of letting it generate. It makes the four cells exactly
    comparable, costs one forward pass each, and removes sampling noise and decoding choices from the measurement.
- term: Benign twin
  definition: >-
    A request lexically and structurally close to a harmful one but carrying no harmful intent, drawn from XSTest's purpose-built
    safe split rather than authored from scratch. Twins are what make the request factor a manipulation of intent rather than
    of vocabulary.
summary: >-
  A response-site safety effect measured only under harmful requests is an average over an unvaried modifier, not a property
  of the model: crossing the request factor with the model's own already-written output splits that effect into an unconditional
  output monitor and a request-gated ARMING term, and the three Qwen3-4B checkpoints differ mainly in which one they have.
  The resulting three-number profile is read from one model's activations with no generation and no judge, and the claim is
  that a prompt-fitted weight edit destroys the arming term and leaves the monitor, so the pre-edit arming measurement forecasts
  how much safety survives the edit.
alternates:
- title: The refusal a model brings before it reads
  hypothesis: >-
    A model's refusal drive decomposes into an input-independent PRIOR, readable from a contentless forward pass with literally
    zero prompts, plus an input-dependent EVIDENCE slope, how far the internals move per unit of actual harmfulness. Published
    safety scores are a fixed monotone mixture of the two, which is why a model that is safer while refusing less is ranked
    backwards, and the two numbers read separately from one checkpoint's internals reproduce the mixture and beat it. Concretely:
    the base model has neither, the refusal-tuned model has a high prior, the safe-completion model has a low prior and a
    high slope, and abliteration drives the prior down while leaving the slope intact.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the arming interaction is swallowed by the coherence calibration -- if the mismatch penalty in the safety crossing
    cannot be matched and A_net survives only as an upper bound -- because then the interesting structure is entirely in the
    request-to-signal mapping and the prior-slope split is the sharpest decom
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
position of it. It also wins on cost, since the
    prior needs zero prompts, the extreme end of what the request asks for. It would have to be positioned tightly against
    signal-detection and item-response-theory treatments of refusal, which make the same conflation argument behaviourally
    rather than at the activation level.
- title: Measure safety without any harmful text
  hypothesis: >-
    A checkpoint's safety level is predictable from its internals on entirely benign or contentless inputs, with no harmful
    content anywhere in the pipeline, because safety training leaves a systematic footprint on ordinary computation. The claim
    is specific rather than correlational: safety training reserves residual-stream capacity and shifts benign computation
    in a direction that abliteration partially reverses, so the size of that shift, measured against the model's own benign
    baseline, orders the arms and transfers across families.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the matched-quadruple construction proves fragile -- if the Stage-0 twin, prefix or placebo gates fail -- since
    it needs no harmful prompts, no twins and no matched prefixes at all. It also wins on deployability: an instrument that
    never touches harmful content can be run on any checkpoint by anyone, and every existing cheap instrument still needs
    a harmful or jailbreak set even when it skips generation. Its risk is the mirror image of the main hypothesis's, since
    a footprint on benign computation may be a footprint of fine-tuning in general, so it lives or dies on the same non-safety
    fine-tune control.
- title: How long the hazard state survives
  hypothesis: >-
    The safety-relevant difference between the checkpoints is the PERSISTENCE of the internal hazard state. Under a fixed
    teacher-forced continuation identical across models, the hazard readout decays with token position at a rate that is a
    stable per-checkpoint property, and its time constant in tokens -- hence unit-free, and immune to the cross-checkpoint
    scale problem that forces every level comparison into null-SD units -- orders the checkpoints and predicts how well safety
    survives long generations. Predicted short in the refusal-tuned model, which only ever needed the signal at token one,
    long in the safe-completion model, near zero in the base model, short in the abliterated model.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the response-conditioned signal is real as a correlation but dies under harm-subspace patching, leaving decay
    rather than feedback as the mechanism, and it wins outright if the depth curve the main design already collects shows
    A is a transient rather than a plateau. It is also the cheaper instrument, needing one prompt and one fixed continuation
    per model rather than a matched quadruple plus a calibrated coherence control, and a decay constant estimates stably at
    small sample sizes where an interaction does not.
- title: Safety is a profile over harm domains
  hypothesis: >-
    Safety is not one mechanism but a set of harm-domain-specific write pathways with independently set gains, so a checkpoint's
    safety is a PROFILE over domains rather than a scalar, and the per-domain gains are readable from one model's internals
    with a handful of prompts per domain. The prediction that makes it testable on this trio: safety RL optimises an aggregate
    reward and should FLATTEN the profile, while abliteration removes a single direction fitted to one extraction set and
    should thin it unevenly, deepest in the domains that dominated that set, leaving a checkpoint genuinely still safe on
    some domains and not others.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if within-checkpoint variation across harm domains is larger than between-checkpoint variation, which would mean
    the field's single safety number is the wrong object however it is measured, and it would make the deliverable a risk
    profile rather than a score. It needs no counterfactual construction, no matched prefixes and no coherence control, so

  EVIDENCE CLASSIFIED weak_or_null. No candidate met the iteration-4 selection rule. The prereg bar (median no-op displacement

  only 0.150 null SD.

  THE ONE POSITIVE IS PARTLY ANALYTIC AND IS RESCALED. Three of the 15 no-ops (head-only unembedding edits) have prompt-site

  WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, BLIND ARTIFACT. A screen that also chooses its own confirmation evidence is not a confirmation. The producer grades behaviour and saves arrays; the scorer (the screen artifact, running in parallel) freezes its candidate list before opening anything here. Neither can contaminate the other, and the ordering is checkable from two independent hash chains.

  PART A -- THE NEW PANEL, >=20 checkpoints from >=6 NEVER-LOADED families at or below 4B. EXCLUDE every family already loaded: Qwen3, Qwen2.5, SmolLM2, SmolLM3, TinyLlama, Phi, Granite, StableLM, OLMo-2, AMD-OLMo, Llama-3.2 (Vikhr / unsloth / mylesgoose), Falcon3, LFM2. Search the Hub live for ungated, non-quantised instruct / base / stage checkpoints in families such as Gemma-2 and Gemma-3, InternLM2.5, MiniCPM, h2o-danube3, EXAONE, Nemotron-Mini-4B, Index-1.9B, Zamba2, bloomz, Sailor2 and arcee small models, subject to licence and ungated status. Draw by a SEEDED SHA-256 rule and log the seed. Include >=3 multi-stage lineages (base / SFT / preference) and any community-edited children that exist, because the edit-robustness co-primary needs them.

  PART B -- THE FRESH IN-HOUSE NO-OP AND EFFECTIVE SET, on a parent family not used in iteration 4 (F1/F2/F3 were Qwen3-0.6B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Falcon3-1B-Instruct). The reviewer's second BLOCKING finding is that three of iteration 4's fifteen no-ops (the wu05 head-only unembedding edits) have prompt-site activation delta EXACTLY ZERO by construction and two system-prompt arms cannot move AMS at all, so part of the headline specificity gap was analytic. The fresh set fixes that at the design level: EVERY no-op must be capable in principle of moving BOTH the activation class and the logit class. Head-only unembedding edits and system-prompt swaps are retained for continuity but flagged STRUCTURALLY DEGENERATE and excluded from the headline denominator. Build at least: bf16/fp16 cast, int8 weight-only round trip, LLM.int8, re-save, a short non-safety LoRA, a short non-safety DPO, and a small perturbation of non-refusal unembedding rows. Also build effective arms: in-house rank-one lesions at two matched strengths, and the family's community-edited child if one exists. A constructed no-op that changes behaviour is RECLASSIFIED and reported, never dropped -- iteration 4 found all three LoRA arms were OR_EFFECTIVE and only one of three DPO arms was a no-op, and that is itself worth reporting.

  PART C -- THE OVER-REFUSAL INSTRUMENT, because over-refusal is now the REGISTERED PRIMARY TARGET and the run currently has two measurements that disagree (XSTest twins 0.11 instruct / 0.00 SafeRL against hard-benign probes 0.438 / 0.479). Measure over-refusal on TWO named benign sets for every checkpoint -- the never-opened 54-scenario XSTest split at /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/heldout_cells.json and the hard-benign / OR-Bench probe set -- and carry the set name in the column header everywhere. Report the range and the ceiling/floor of each instrument across the panel, because a range-restricted target is the single most likely reason the primary test returns null and a reader must be able to see it. Also report safe-engagement rate, which penalises a blanket refuser.

  ORDER, enforced by a SHA-256 hash chain and an append-only build log:
   (1) panel rule and seeded draw, committed; (2) greedy generation on the behavioural items plus both benign sets; (3) grading with the run's existing frozen judge and rubric (/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_3/lc_judge.py, rubric hashes in the iteration-2 dataset); (4) graded_truth.json committed with its hash; (5) ONLY THEN the activation harvest in the iteration-2

layout plus a short greedy decode pass, plus the SAME forward-only intervention passes the screen uses (6 bands x 32 prompts x F / N6 / >=10 matched-norm orthogonalised R draws) so the scorer needs no GPU to join; (6) arrays and graded truth appended to results/panel_manifest.json after EACH checkpoint, so a parallel scorer can consume a partial panel.

  NO SCORING HERE. Save arrays, directions, graded rates and the manifest. Do not compute W1-W8, G1-G4, A1-A3, any rho, or any ranking. Any file named survivor, winner or rank is a protocol violation.

  REUSABLE MACHINERY. A previous session left a complete, unrelated confirmation-panel working tree at /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_2/prior_session_confirm_panel/ -- it is explicitly NOT part of that experiment and was moved aside, but it contains exactly the machinery this artifact needs: src/harvest_confirm.py, src/harvest_panel.py, src/panel.py, src/gen.py, src/ams_run.py, src/stats_confirm.py, a hash_chain.jsonl, a panel_rule with its sha256, and its own uv project. Read it before writing anything new.

  SCALING AND BUDGET. 1 checkpoint end to end, then 5, then all, timing each stage; if fewer than 20 fit the budget, report the achieved n and its MDE rather than lowering the bar. Judge spend tracked after every batch, planned at $3-5 of the $10 cap, stopped on approach. VRAM budget 7.5 GB under the lease protocol; stream one checkpoint at a time and DELETE its snapshot after harvesting. Set HF_HOME inside this workspace on the network mount -- the container root filesystem is 40 GB and 20 checkpoints will not fit on it. Hygiene: release judged labels, rates and activation statistics only; keep raw completions on harmful items out of the outputs; do not release edited weights.


  VERIFIED ASSET INVENTORY (re-read from disk this session; use these paths and names, do not guess).
   PATH NOTE, IMPORTANT. An EXPERIMENT may only declare DATASET and RESEARCH dependencies, so none of
   the prior EXPERIMENT artifacts below is a declared dependency and none of their out_dependency_files
   will be handed to you at execution time. Every path in this block is READ DIRECTLY FROM DISK with an
   absolute path. Check each one exists before planning around it and log a deviation if it does not.
   ENVIRONMENT IS NOT ON DISK. The .venv, .venv_gpu and .venv_ams directories were REAPED after
   iteration 4. Rebuild first with `bash restore.sh gpu` (or all) in
   /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1, which is uv-based and pins Python 3.12, numpy 2.5.3,
   torch 2.9.1+cu128 from download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128, transformers 5.17.0, and a separate AMS
   venv pinning ams-scanner[cli]==0.1.3. Budget time for this before anything else.
   HARVEST: 53 tag directories under
   /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1/harvest/<tag>/, each with the SAME 27-file schema and a
   MANIFEST.sha256.json plus a DONE marker. A_prompt.npy is (256, L+1, d) float16 prompt-site
   per-layer; A_prompt_p1/p2/p3.npy are three expression-only perturbation renders; A_ams.npy is
   (96, L+1, d); A_c11.npy is (64, L+1, d); A_dec.npy is (160, L+1, d) mean-pooled over generated
   positions and A_dec_tok1.npy is the first generated token only, with dec_ntok.npy the token counts
   -- SO A DECODE-SITE PASS ALREADY EXISTS FOR ALL 53 TAGS and W7's correlational half is free, while
   only its intervention half needs new GPU work. WU_ref/WU_hed/WU_ctl.npy are the refusal (44), hedge
   (16) and control (56) unembedding rows that G4 projects out. meta.json carries n_layers and
   hidden_size, which differ across families (1024 / 2048 / 2560), so EVERY band must be defined as a
   fraction of depth, never as a layer index.
   GRADED TRUTH: results/graded_truth.json holds 72 checkpoint rows with per-item refused /
   harmful_content / on_topic_help labels, so harmful compliance AND over-refusal are already
   available for all of them at zero

<pasted_content id="9a37">
 further judge cost. That is a far larger screen panel than the
   24 assumed at planning time, and the screen should use all rows that pass the size and family
   rules rather than a subset. Note F1__cautious at OR 0.976 and F3__cautious at 0.843: the panel
   already contains near-blanket refusers, which is exactly what G2 needs to be tested against.
   CLASSIFICATION: results/classification.json holds 56 pairs with B=2000, seed 20260921, and the
   fields primary_noop_pairs (the 15) and primary_effective_pairs (the 9), each pair carrying dHC,
   dOR, dSE with CIs and an observed_class.
   CODE TO REUSE RATHER THAN REWRITE, with exact entry points: src/ncands.py axis_weight_vector() fits
   the request axis and crossfit_lstar() does the cross-fitted layer choice; N6 is computed inside
   src/ncands.py values(); src/ams_reimpl.py ams_tier1() and ams_tier2() are the AMS bar, validated
   against the released CLI below 1e-4; src/harvest_variants.py dec_harvest() is the greedy
   decode-site pass; src/judge.py judge_file() is the judge runner with its cost ledger;
   src/truth_classify.py paired_boot() is the B=2000 paired bootstrap and rule() is the
   NOOP / EFFECTIVE / OR_EFFECTIVE / AMBIGUOUS classifier. src_i3/candidates.py holds the iteration-3
   candidate conventions that ncands.py inherits.


  GPU CO-TENANCY, mandatory. Three artifacts in this iteration use the single NVIDIA L4 (23,034 MiB,
  48 cores, 62 GB cgroup RAM). Verified this session: GPU idle, /ai-inventor/aii_data is a 2.2 PB
  network mount with ~669 TB free, but the container ROOT filesystem is only 40 GB, so HF_HOME and
  TRANSFORMERS_CACHE MUST be set to a directory inside this artifact's own workspace on the network
  mount, never left at ~/.cache, or model downloads will fill the overlay and the pod will fail.
  Delete each checkpoint's snapshot after harvesting it.

  Cooperate on VRAM with a lease file at
  /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gpu_lease/leases.json,
  guarded by fcntl.flock on a sibling lock file. Before loading any model, append a record
  {pid, artifact, mib, utc} if the sum of live leases plus your request stays under 22,500 MiB;
  release on unload in a finally block. THE THREE BUDGETS (12.5 + 4.5 + 7.5 = 24.5 GB) DELIBERATELY
  OVER-SUBSCRIBE THE 23 GB CARD: that is not a bug, it is the lease doing its job by serialising the
  peaks, since the three artifacts spend most of their wall clock on downloads, grading, judging and
  CPU scoring rather than on a resident model. Hold a lease only while weights are actually on the
  device, and unload between checkpoints. A lease whose UTC start is older than 20 minutes AND whose pid
  is not alive is reclaimable by anyone. If a lease cannot be acquired within 30 minutes, proceed
  anyway at half batch with PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True and log the deviation.
  Cap yourself with torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction and halve the batch on
  torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError rather than dying. Never kill a process by name; PID-based only.
  Set TORCH_DISABLE_NATIVE_JIT=1, which a previous session found necessary on this pod.

ataset (7604 examples): xstest_v2, or_bench_toxic, or_bench_hard_1k, strongreject_small, advbench_harmful_behaviors, jbb_behaviors_harmful, jbb_behaviors_benign, phtest, harmbench, databricks_dolly_15k. Built by data.py (stdlib only; `uv run --no-project data.py`). 15 candidates were standardised and inspected, 5 discarded with written reasons (redundancy, schema fit, unverified licence, CC-BY-NC); all 15 remain at results/full_data_out_all15.json. metadata_harm_domain uses the OR-Bench 10-value vocabulary; XSTest rows read theirs from results/twin_pairs.json so the corpora and the substrate carry ONE label per row.

  THE ACTUAL SUBSTRATE (data_out.json, 3,014 rows + heldout_cells.json, 1,350 SEALED rows): 150 genuine XSTest v2 minimal-edit twin pairs (focus-join and +25 offset agree on 149/150), hash-split 96 confirmatory / 54 sealed BEFORE any cell text existed (salt and both id-list SHA-256s in prereg.json). 3,877 rendered cells, every one exactly 144 tokens with its action slot intersecting BOTH read windows (EARLY 5-20, LATE 40-55) under the real Qwen/Qwen3-4B tokenizer; within an item+family the hazardous, benign and placebo continuations have IDENTICAL token counts at EVERY index and differ only inside the two slot regions. Tables: safety_2x2, placebo, coherence_control (also crossed with prefix family, a deliberate superset of the planned 600), graded_harm_ladder, contentless, fixed_shared_continuation, fitting_corpus (64 pairs, 0 shared action lemmas/4-grams with XSTest), harm_domain_profile, three behavioural request sets. Siblings: prereg.json (sha256 0b86d66a8dffca717f8c523569ab04a0987134158e36c342e738ab93b8027f50), model_registry.json (40 repos, metadata only, 36 ungated, 12 families with an ungated instruct arm, 2 SEALED: Qwen2.5-1.5B, SmolLM2-1.7B), judge_validation.json, rubric.md, templates.json, sources_manifest.json, verification_report.json.

  WHAT FAILED, AND IS REPORTED AS FAILED (do not read these as passes):
  1. Prefix HAZARD identification gate FAILED at 0.9429 vs a 0.95 threshold after the one regeneration round the plan allows. The threshold was NOT relaxed: the 16 affected items are marked metadata_qc_fail=true and metadata_confirmatory=false, and CONFIRMATORY n DROPS FROM 96 TO 85. 11 of the 16 are benign/placebo prefixes a rater called hazardous, concentrated in historical_events and safe_contexts, whose benign member is an explanatory act ABOUT a harmful topic.
  2. Placebo distance gate FAILED: median edit distance ratio 1.25 vs the required <=1.10. A floor, not a search failure: a placebo SELECTED from another item's benign action cannot beat the ~5-token distance between two unrelated short phrases, and enlarging the pool 100->164 does not move the median. Mean ratio is 1.133 and 99/150 items match exactly; per-item distances ship as metadata_levenshtein_to_benign_prefix so a lane regresses on them instead of subtracting a constant.
  3. XSTest CANNOT supply 6 harm domains: it is violence-skewed and only 3 of 10 reach 8 confirmatory twin pairs. Thin domains are topped up from OR-Bench with twin_available=false, so K5's per-domain profile rests PARTLY ON NON-TWIN items. The 2x2 and the ladder use twins ONLY; no non-twin row ever enters the 2x2.
  4. Only 4 of the 6 contrast families are SURFACE-minimal. definitions and historical_events are matched on topic via the shared focus term but rewrite the sentence frame; metadata_minimal_edit_tier ships so a lane needing a small surface edit can restrict to Tier A (100 pairs, 64 confirmatory).
  5. The ladder covers 149 of 150 items; one pair was declined by both model families and its rungs 1-3 are null.
  6. There is NO human rater anywhere in this pipeline; two cross-family LLM raters substitute. A substitution, not an equivalence.

  GATES THAT PASSED: twin-member identification 0.9967, announce-vs-enact 0.9506, ladder Spearman rho 0.878, non-operationality 0 flags over 360 distinct hazardous continuations, pooled Cohen's kappa 0.8953. 32/33 verification checks pass.

title: Model pairs, hard prompts, refusal tokens
summary: |-
  FROZEN ITERATION-2 SUBSTRATE for the Qwen3-4B safety mech-interp run: model pairs, hard prompts, refusal tokens. Nothing touches a model - 0 safetensors files, no forward pass, no activations, no metric. 125.49 MB downloaded vs a 300 MB cap; $0 spent.

  GATES 22 PASS / 3 FAIL / 0 N/A. FAILED, with numbers, thresholds NOT relaxed: G_EFFECTIVE_IN_STRATUM (need >= 4, got 2); G_NONEFFECTIVE (need >= 2, got 0); G_PROXY_HARD (need <= 0.85 (FAIL above 0.90), got 0.8852).

  FREEZE CAME FIRST AND IS CHECKABLE. prereg.json hashed 03:38:26Z BEFORE any label, split or proxy existed; append-only build_log.txt proves the order. sha256 b3849ae02159573c253b85644bb2a4c7fd9712db531bbccf03e8917f40d11f12 is asserted equal across the file on disk, prereg.sha256 and the copy inside full_data_out.json (G_PREREG_HASH) - iteration 1 shipped a prereg hash disagreeing with its own manifest. The freeze script refuses to overwrite.

  TEN SETS, 10808 examples, one per row (per-set counts in full_data_out.json metadata and README.md). Plus sealed_truth.json and the prereg/gates freeze = twelve.

  REGISTRY 42 checkpoints, 18 pairs, 13 families, from 1587 Hub candidates screened live. safetensors bytes SUMMED FROM THE FILE LIST, not usedStorage. Raw card text ships verbatim - the card+name REGEX BASELINE the screen must beat is computed from it. Labels {"EFFECTIVE": 3, "SEALED": 2, "AMBIGUOUS": 3, "UNSCORED": 10}.

  HEADLINE NEGATIVE: at n=45+45, HALF THE SCORABLE PAIRS CANNOT BE LABELLED ROBUSTLY. 3 EFFECTIVE with a Newcombe 95% CI wholly above +0.15 (Qwen3-0.6B +0.467 [0.270,0.616]; Qwen3-1.7B +0.667 [0.501,0.786]; Josiefied-Qwen2.5-1.5B +0.467 [0.308,0.609]). 3 DEMOTED to AMBIGUOUS by the frozen label_robust rule despite point estimates crossing: SmolLM3 +0.289 [0.086,0.461], Phi-4-mini +0.244 [0.116,0.387], granite 0.000 [-0.079,0.079]. Hence G_EFFECTIVE_IN_STRATUM (2, need 4) and G_NONEFFECTIVE (0, need 2) fail: granite's NULL_EDIT was demoted and the one real ANOMALOUS pair (venkycs SmolLM2, over-refusal 1.000) is in a SEALED family. Strata NOT widened to rescue the count; the 4-pair requirement must be met partly by the lane's in-house rank-one edits.

  10 pairs UNSCORED, never zero-filled: 8 FRESH (3 held_out by a seeded sha256 rule fixed before scoring), the commissioned Qwen3-4B -> mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated pair (ungated; the gated='auto' huihui variant refused), and TinyLlama, EXCLUDED as missing_shards - unloadable, not a null-edit control.

  JOIN EXACT: 26 checkpoints recomputed from 2370 judged rows match published columns to 0.000e+00 - but only after adopting iteration 1's denominator convention, since 1 row (Phi-4-mini benign orh_244) has an unparsable judge output it drops. The first run FAILED at 1.46e-2; build_log.txt records both.

  RECOGNITION SET 1509 rows, 771 benign / 738 harmful, built to kill the ceiling that made iteration 1's premise test unfalsifiable. HARDNESS MEASURED: TF-IDF+char-ngram logistic proxy, 5-fold CV, AUROC 0.9561 on easy anchors (PASS, the saturating pole) and 0.8852 on hard+borderline+wrapped vs a <=0.85 target -

 a FAIL, below the 0.90 rebalance trigger, with `wrapped` named as the leaking stratum and top-20 features shipped. Dedup removed 0 exact + 31 near; disjointness from iteration 1's 96/54 XSTest split asserted at 0. graded_harm on 23 rows from PKU-SafeRLHF ordinal severity, null elsewhere, never invented.

  TOKENS from 2369 real generations, 9 families; no iteration-1 lexicon exists (grep-verified). Refusal-onset 60 forms, all in >=3 families, opening 0.7587 of 1,115 refusing generations vs 0.3552 for the constructed naive comparator; top-30 Jaccard 0.25 vs do-not-answer, so a behaviour not a template. HEDGE TOOK 3 PASSES, THE FIRST TWO SHIPPED AS EVIDENCE OF FAILURE: a 2-document pool crowned its content words ("abraham lincoln", lift 1632), and widening to 147 docs with a document-frequency lift and prompt-echo stripping stayed topic-confounded - 147 generations over 45 prompts cannot separate style from topical halo. Pass 3 DECLARES a hedge-marker frame and mines 24 forms in it. Controls 28/35 inside the 0.25 caliper. Tokenizer table 128 forms x 28 tokenizers x 2 variants, 0 failures, 0 dropped; mid-text variant PRIMARY.

  PROBES: all pairwise prompt-hash intersections ZERO. 160/154 reused VERBATIM from iteration 1; 200 NEW auto-gradable with no judge (ARC-Easy + GSM8K, key in `output`); 40 from the never-loaded sealed split. Judge rubric verbatim with SHA-256s so new rows pool with the 2,370.

  SEAL ALREADY COMPROMISED AND SAID SO: both sealed pairs' deltas appear in the iteration-2 strategy text, so seal_status=DISCLOSED_UPSTREAM; only the seeded FRESH pairs and the sealed split are blind.

  CONTRACT: filter on label_robust, NOT effectiveness_label alone, or 3 CI-straddling pairs look decided. Every row carries readout_class; registry and card text are BASELINE by construction. Never read sealed_truth.json or the sealed_holdout split in a fitting lane.

title: Is our safety-readout audit still unclaimed?
summary: |-
  Web-only prior-art and bibliography pass, 2026-09-21, $0 spend. 62/62 quoted passages re-verified by independent live re-fetch; 36 sources.
  VERDICT: the iteration-4 empty cell is OPEN but NARROWER. No paper has both C1 (no-op/false-alarm controls) and C2 (over-refusal) CLOSED. Closest new paper: arXiv:2609.18471 'First Token Matters' (2026-09-16), which has a decode-site readout at generated tokens, Logit-Lens, two-sided steering and XSTest, but no no-op controls; its XSTest is a behavioural outcome of defences and it covers only 2 R1-distilled checkpoints. New C1 neighbour: Duan arXiv:2606.15980 freezes probes (incl. an XSTest refusal-compliance probe) across 12 quantisation/LoRA/QLoRA updates on Qwen2.5-7B/Gemma-2-2B. It scores per-input AUC, not a per-checkpoint score, and does not grade behaviour. Other C1 PARTIALs: AMS (single-model FP16/INT8/INT4, drift ≤4.4%), Aligned Probing (toxicity quantisation, OLMo), Hurtado 2607.01854 (37 benign fine-tunes, FPR 0.11, reference-anchored). Also new: 2609.04721 (XSTest+OR-Bench gate, orthogonalised-random controls). N-GLARE's Refusal Rate is keyword refusal on HARMFUL prompts, so it is NOT over-refusal. 'Messenger 2026 IEEE Access' IS AMS 2608.05578.
  SURVIVING CLAIM: per-checkpoint false-alarm audit on BEHAVIOURALLY GRADED no-ops (casts, re-downloads, non-safety LoRA/DPO; template on/off as a graded expression arm) + over-refusal as the TARGET of internal readouts (OPEN everywhere) + logit gap AND AMS σ side by side + site-local matched-norm vs orthogonal-random test.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


<shared_pod_budget>
Every artifact in this run executes on ONE shared pod: 58 GB of RAM, 5 CPU cores, and a 16 GB-class NVIDIA card with 22 GB of VRAM. Up to 5 artifact agents run on it at the same time, and the admission gate hands out at most 46 GB of that RAM between them — the rest is held back for the orchestrator process itself.

Declare what THIS artifact's executor will need as `ram_gb` and `vram_gb`, and justify both in the plan's summary against what the plan actually loads: model weights, the rows held in memory at once, every worker process it forks. Size the declaration so the largest 5 RAM declarations in this run 
</pasted_content id="9a37">


<pasted_content id="9a37">
still sum to under 46 GB, and the largest 5 VRAM declarations under 22 GB. A batch whose declarations do not fit the pod is rejected before any of it runs, and the plans that caused the overflow are dropped.

The declaration is enforced, not advisory. The step is admitted against it and its process tree is sampled while it runs; a tree that goes past its own declaration is stopped and killed, and the agent is handed a failure naming both the limit and the peak it reached, which costs the artifact a whole retry. Under-declaring spends attempts; over-declaring keeps siblings from starting at all. Declare the peak you genuinely expect, with a little headroom, and plan the work to fit inside it.
</shared_pod_budget>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

qwen3 4B on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated (use the 4B size of each so they fit on a 16GB GPU). take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

invariant: the deliverable is the activation-level comparison of the three models and any metric built from it must read activations or weights of a single model. logit-only or text-only readouts are baselines, not the result. this is a mech interp study of where safety lives, not a jailbreak or attack-selection study; do not reframe it as one.

READ-ONLY reconnaissance. Do not write any files except a scratch note if you must; report back in your final message only.

Target: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_2/prior_session_confirm_panel/

Task: produce a precise inventory of this working tree so a PLANNER can tell an executor exactly what to reuse.

Do this:
1. `find` the tree (max depth 3), list every file with size. Note whether .venv exists.
2. Read src/harvest_confirm.py, src/harvest_panel.py, src/panel.py, src/gen.py, src/ams_run.py, src/stats_confirm.py (and any other src/*.py). For EACH file report: its purpose in 1-2 sentences, its CLI entry point (argparse flags, exact invocation), the exact signatures of its top-level functions, what files it writes and in what layout (array names, shapes, dtypes).
3. Read panel_rule* (json/py) and report the EXACT rule: how candidates were listed from the Hub (HfApi call + filters), how ungated/non-quantised/size were checked, the seeded draw (seed value, hash rule), and its sha256.
4. Read hash_chain.jsonl (first 3 and last 3 records) and report the exact record schema and how the chain is computed.
5. Report the uv project files (pyproject.toml / uv.lock) verbatim dependency pins.
6. If a checkpoint list exists anywhere in the tree (panel candidates drawn), report the full list of repo ids and their families.
7. Report anything that would BLOCK reuse (hardcoded paths, missing modules, references to files that no longer exist — check existence of anything it imports or opens by absolute path).

Output format: markdown, grouped by file, with exact function signatures and exact CLI lines. Be complete but do not paste whole files — quote only signatures, argparse blocks, and the array-writing lines. Max ~1200 words.

Root: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1/

Report, precisely:
1. restore.sh — quote it (or its key lines): what venvs it builds, exact package pins, the index URLs, how it is invoked (`bash restore.sh gpu|all|...`), and roughly how long/what it downloads. Also list which of .venv/.venv_gpu/.venv_ams currently exist on disk (they may have been reaped).
2. `ls harvest/` — the full list of tag directory names (these are the ALREADY-LOADED checkpoints; I need them to build an exclusion list). For each tag, if there is a meta.json, report the HF repo id, n_layers, hidden_size. If there are >53, just give the complete tag list plus repo ids compactly (one per line).
3. `ls harvest/<one tag>/` — the exact 27-file schema: every filename, and for each .npy its shape and dtype (read the header with numpy if a venv is available; otherwise parse the .npy header bytes with python stdlib — do NOT install anything). Also quote meta.json for that tag verbatim.
4. results/graded_truth.json — report the top-level structure, the exact per-checkpoint row schema (all keys), how many rows, and which benign/harmful item sets the labels come from (item ids / set names). Quote ONE complete row (truncating long lists) so the planner knows the exact field names.
5. results/classification.json — top-level keys, the schema of an entry in primary_noop_pairs and primary_effective_pairs (quote one of each), and the recipe/arm names used for the 15 no-ops and 9 effective pairs.
6. src/ — list all .py files. For src/ncands.py quote the signatures of axis_weight_vector() and crossfit_lstar() and the lines where N6 is computed inside values(); for src/harvest_variants.py quote dec_harvest()'s signature and the lines that write A_dec/A_dec_tok1/dec_ntok; for src/judge.py quote judge_file()'s signature and the cost-ledger lines INCLUDING the exact OpenRouter model id used and the price constants; for src/truth_classify.py quote paired_boot() and rule(); for src/ams_reimpl.py quote ams_tier1()/ams_tier2() signatures. Also report whether a GPU intervention/causal-grid driver script exists in src/ (a previous session noted the iteration-4 causal-grid driver may be MISSING from src/) — say explicitly which driver files exist and which are absent.
7. Any GPU lease helper code already written anywhere under this root (search for 'leases.json' or 'flock') — quote it if found.

Be exact about paths and names. Max ~1500 words.

   2. data_out.json — list the table names present (metadata_table or equivalent) and the row counts per table; report the field names for the behavioural request sets (there are three) and for the hard-benign / over-refusal probe rows, plus how metadata_qc_fail / metadata_confirmatory / metadata_fold are encoded.
   3. rubric.md — report its sha256 and quote its grading categories/labels (refused / harmful_content / on_topic_help or whatever it actually uses).
   4. prereg.json — report its sha256 field and the id-list hashes for the 96/54 split.

B) /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_3/lc_judge.py — quote its CLI/argparse, the exact OpenRouter model id(s) it calls, its prompt template structure (summarise), the JSON output schema it writes per item, and any cost ledger. State whether it reads an API key from an env var and which.

C) /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/full_data_out.json — this is the iteration-2 substrate (10 sets, 10808 rows). Report: the exact set names and row counts; the schema of the refusal-onset token lexicon rows (60 forms), the hedge lexicon (24), and the control tokens; the schema of the model_registry rows (42 checkpoints — give the full list of repo ids and their family labels, since I need an ALREADY-CONSIDERED list); and the schema + ids of the ARC-Easy/GSM8K auto-gradable probe rows (200) and the 40 rows drawn from the sealed split.

Web research task (use the aii-web-tools skill for search/fetch; you may also use the `huggingface_hub` HTTP API via a plain unauthenticated GET to https://huggingface.co/api/models/<repo_id> if a shell/python is available to you — an unauthenticated fetch of that JSON reveals "gated": false/"auto"/"manual" and the siblings file list).

GOAL: for a research panel I need >=20 ungated, NON-quantised HuggingFace text LLM checkpoints at or below 4B parameters, drawn from at least 6 model FAMILIES, EXCLUDING every family already used: Qwen3, Qwen2.5 (and any model whose base is Qwen2.x/3.x, e.g. Sailor2, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen), SmolLM2, SmolLM3, TinyLlama, Phi, Granite, StableLM, OLMo-2, AMD-OLMo, Llama-3.2 (incl. Vikhr/unsloth/mylesgoose derivatives), Falcon3, LFM2.

For EACH of the following candidate repo ids, report: (a) does it exist, (b) is it GATED (requires accepting a licence / auth) or freely downloadable anonymously, (c) parameter count, (d) licence, (e) whether it is a quantised repo, (f) what its base model is (to check the family-exclusion rule):

  Then, ALSO search the Hub for 4-8 MORE ungated <=4B candidates from families not in the exclusion list (ideas to check: MobileLLM, Salesforce, Arcee, Trillion Labs, Motif, Rene/Cartesia, K2/LLM360, Pleias, Teuken, Aleph Alpha, Poro, OpenELM (apple), Danube, Yi-1.5-6B is too big, RWKV, Mamba/Codestral-Mamba, Hymba (nvidia), Bitnet — say which are ungated and <=4B, and note if they are non-standard architectures that transformers may not load with AutoModelForCausalLM).

ALSO REPORT, explicitly:
- Which of these families offer a MULTI-STAGE LINEAGE on the Hub (base + SFT/instruct + preference/DPO variants of the SAME parent) — I need >=3 such lineages.
- Which of these parents have a COMMUNITY-EDITED child (e.g. an "abliterated"/"uncensored" variant) that is ungated and <=4B — search for e.g. "gemma-3-1b abliterated", "internlm abliterated", "MiniCPM abliterated", "danube abliterated", "Index-1.9B uncensored". Give exact repo ids.
- Which of these load with a standard transformers AutoModelForCausalLM + AutoTokenizer without trust_remote_code, and which REQUIRE trust_remote_code=True (MiniCPM, Zamba2, Index are suspects) — this matters a lot for my plan.
- Per-repo approximate download size in GB (bf16/fp16 safetensors).

Output a single markdown table plus a short "recommended parent family for in-house edit experiments" paragraph naming ONE family that is ungated, <=2B, loads without trust_remote_code, and has both a base and an instruct arm. Be honest about what you could not verify. Max ~900 words.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

File: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json

Steps:
1. Run `python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(open(PATH)); print(sorted(d.keys())); print({k:(len(v) if isinstance(v,str) else v) for k,v in d.items()})"` (substitute the real path).
2. If it parses: confirm the keys are exactly title, summary, runpod_compute_profile, ram_gb, vram_gb, implementation_pseudocode, fallback_plan, testing_plan; confirm no value still contains the substring "PLACEHOLDER". Report the character length of each string field.
3. If it does NOT parse: report the exact json.JSONDecodeError message with line/column, and print the ~200 characters of the raw file around that offset so I can fix it. Then FIX ONLY the escaping defect (e.g. an unescaped double quote or a raw control character inside a string) — do not alter wording, do not reflow, do not add or remove content — and re-validate. Report exactly what you changed, character by character.
4. Also delete the stray scratch file /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/plan_body.md if it exists.

Report: PARSES / FIXED (with the diff) / BROKEN (with the error), plus the key list and field lengths. Keep it under 200 words.

name: aii-json
description: "Validates JSON files against this repo's experiment-pipeline schemas (exp_sel_data_out, exp_gen_sol_out, exp_eval_sol_out, exp_proof_out) and generates size-optimized full, mini and preview variants of any JSON array file. ALWAYS use before treating a pipeline stage output as finished, whenever a schema or required-property error must be fixed, and whenever a large JSON file needs a small truncated version safe to read. Triggers: JSON schema validation, schema compliance, required property errors, pipeline stage outputs, the exp_*_out format names, mini and preview JSON generation, shrinking a large JSON before inspection. NOT for: discovering or downloading new datasets, which aii-hf-datasets and aii-owid-datasets cover; splitting oversized output files, which aii-file-size-limit covers; plotting JSON data, which aii-data-fig-gen covers; spreadsheet and .csv tabular data, which anthropic-xlsx covers."

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Experiment Pipeline** — the four formats `schemas/` actually holds and
`AVAILABLE_FORMATS` in `scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py` accepts (this
list used to name six hypothesis-selection schemas that exist nowhere and
omit the proof one; corrected 2026-09-03):
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format
- `exp_proof_out.json` - Experiment Proof format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

Quick check, be fast. File: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json

1. `python3 -c` json.load it. If it parses, print the key list and each string field's length, and STOP — report "PARSES".
2. If it fails, report the exact JSONDecodeError (line/col) and the raw ~200 chars around that offset, then fix ONLY the escaping defect (unescaped double quote, raw newline, bad backslash) without changing any wording, and re-validate.
3. Delete the stray file plan_body.md in that same directory if it exists.

Fast final check. File: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json

1. json.load it with python3. If it parses: print the key list and the length of each string field, reply "PARSES" plus those numbers. 
2. If it fails: report the JSONDecodeError line/col and the raw ~200 chars around it, fix ONLY the escaping defect (unescaped `"`, raw newline, stray backslash) without changing any wording or content, re-validate, and report exactly what you changed.
3. Delete plan_body.md in that directory if it exists.

Fast check, then stop. File: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_5/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json

Run python3 json.load on it. If it parses, reply "PARSES" with the key list and each string field's length. If it fails, report the JSONDecodeError line/col plus the raw ~200 chars around that offset, then fix ONLY the escaping defect (unescaped double quote, raw newline, stray backslash) without changing any wording, re-validate, and say exactly what you changed.
