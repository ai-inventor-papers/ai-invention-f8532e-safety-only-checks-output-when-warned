<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are deciding where a research run points next, using the evidence it
gathered this iteration. Your revised hypothesis IS the next iteration's
hypothesis — nothing else steers the run — so this is a steering decision
first and a piece of honest reflection second.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results. A number that was
  projected, assumed or left as a placeholder is not a result.
- CLASSIFY THE EVIDENCE BEFORE CHOOSING A MOVE. The move follows from the
  classification and the remaining budget by a fixed rule; it is not a
  free judgement, because that is exactly where past runs went wrong.
- A weak or null result with budget left is a signal to go WIDER, not
  smaller. The question the user asked is still open; the answer you tried
  is the only thing that was refuted.
- Never shrink the claim until the effect you happened to observe becomes
  the claim. A finding nobody needed is worse than an honest negative.
- A clean negative result is a LAST RESORT, not a deliverable. It is the
  right output only when no iteration and no candidate remain.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates; do not inflate confidence
  without strong evidence.
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation.

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.

<current_hypothesis>
The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

kind: hypothesis
title: Safety only checks output when warned
hypothesis: |-
  THE PRIMARY CLAIM IS METHODOLOGICAL AND IT IS TRUE OR FALSE WHICHEVER CHECKPOINT WINS. A response-site
  safety effect reported without varying the request is an average over an unvaried modifier, so it is
  not a property of the model. The field now reports a single number for "the model's internals react to
  its own hazardous output". Cross the request factor with it and that number splits in two, and the two
  pieces come apart across checkpoints and across a weight edit. The per-checkpoint mechanism below is
  the instantiation of that claim, not a replacement for it.

  WHAT IS CONCEDED, ONCE. arXiv:2607.14147 holds the request harmful, varies the content of the model's
  own response, reads the harm direction at response positions and concludes refusal is "a shallow,
  response-site computation". The response-site pathway is therefore not claimed here. Its pre-registered
  2x2 is harm crossed with SURFACE trigger density, run in the plain condition; under the prefill the
  request is harmful in every headline cell, and benign requests appear only as a 24-prompt specificity
  control inside one intervention arm, yielding a behavioural difference-in-differences of +16.8 points.
  That is the closest published quantity to the one proposed here, and the distance is worth being exact
  about: a refusal-rate difference attached to an intervention, on unmatched benign prompts, not an
  activation-level interaction over matched twins reported as a property of the checkpoint.

  THE ESTIMAND. For each item, teacher-forced cells crossing REQUEST in {harmful, matched benign twin}
  with the model's ALREADY-WRITTEN response prefix in {hazardous, benign}, identical token spans read in
  all four. Write s_ij for the internal harm readout, i the request, j the prefix:
    O  = request main effect      = 0.5*[(s_H,haz + s_H,ben) - (s_B,haz + s_B,ben)]
    CB = unconditional monitoring = s_B,haz - s_B,ben      (response sensitivity under a BENIGN request)
    A  = ARMING (the interaction) = (s_H,haz - s_H,ben) - (s_B,haz - s_B,ben)
  A is how much MORE the safety signal reacts to the model's own hazardous output when the request
  already looked dangerous. Three regimes, which is why the answer is a pair and never a scalar:
  (CB~0, A~0) no output monitoring, a pure front-door gate; (CB~0, A large) an ARMED monitor the request
  switches on; (CB large, A~0) an ALWAYS-ON monitor. What the literature reports is CB + A at one request
  level, and that single number cannot tell the second regime from the third.

  THE READOUT IS A RESPONSE-CONTENT AXIS AND NOT THE ABLITERATION AXIS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES STAGE 2
  MEASURE ANYTHING. r_content is fitted by difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATIONS
  at RESPONSE positions under one held-fixed neutral request. Abliteration's direction is a difference in
  means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the last PROMPT token. Had the readout been that second
  vector, orthogonalising it out of every writing matrix would drive the residual component along it
  toward zero at all positions, and the parent-fixed post-edit O, CB and A would collapse into the null
  band because the coordinate was deleted, not because the model lost a monitor: the equivalence test on
  A would pass mechanically and the survival test on CB would fail mechanically. Two pre-registered
  guards make that outcome detectable rather than invisible. First, |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| must be at
  most 0.50; above it the parent-fixed arm is declared confounded by construction and reported only under
  the per-checkpoint refit and the full probe, with the parent-fixed numbers shown as a labelled
  artefact. Second, a component-preservation diagnostic: the variance of the edited model's residual
  stream along r_content, against the variance along 20 matched-norm random directions at the same layers
  and positions. At floor, every post-edit term is an annihilation residue and is reported as one. In the
  edited arm the direction is carried over from the parent, never refitted inside a fold.
  That first guard is also a result in its own right, and it is worth saying so rather than leaving it as
  plumbing: no published work reports how similar a harm axis fitted from hazardous-versus-benign
  CONTINUATIONS is to the refusal axis fitted from harmful-versus-benign REQUESTS at the prompt. The
  number is unmeasured, it is cheap, and it bounds every prompt-fitted defence and every prompt-fitted
  edit at once -- a small cosine means an entire family of request-axis interventions is operating in a
  coordinate that is nearly orthogonal to where the model's reaction to its own output lives.

  UNITS, BECAUSE RAW PROJECTIONS ARE NOT COMPARABLE ACROSS CHECKPOINTS. Residual-stream norms and
  LayerNorm gains differ between a base model, an instruct model, an RL-tuned model and a weight-edited
  one, and the edit moves them again, so a checkpoint with a 20 percent larger residual norm shows 20
  percent larger O, CB and A with no difference in mechanism. Every CROSS-checkpoint quantity is
  therefore reported in that checkpoint's own NULL-SD units: the per-item standard deviation of the same
  contrast computed under at least 20 random unit directions in that same checkpoint, which the design
  already computes for its null bands and which carries the checkpoint's scale with it. Raw internal
  units stay primary for WITHIN-checkpoint comparisons, both are printed side by side, and a descriptive
  table of per-checkpoint mean residual norm and LayerNorm scale at the frozen band is mandatory, so a
  reader can see how large the scale differences actually are.

  THE HEADLINE: ABLITERATION REMOVES THE ARMING AND LEAVES THE MONITOR. Abliteration fits one direction
  on the request axis and orthogonalises it out of every matrix that writes to the residual stream.
  Everything it is fitted on lives on the request axis, so it should delete the request's ability to arm
  the monitor and leave a monitor that never depended on the request. Stated with no denominator
  anywhere, because the prediction itself drives some denominators to zero: (i) A falls inside the
  measured null band in BOTH lineages after the edit; (ii) CB stays above it wherever it was above it
  before; (iii) the load-bearing test is a DIFFERENCE IN DIFFERENCES of one term, measured as a CHANGE,
  at matched request-axis damage.

  WHICH TERM THAT DIFFERENCE IN DIFFERENCES IS STATED ON MATTERS, AND THE OBVIOUS CHOICE IS WRONG. A
  post-edit LEVEL comparison, CB_post in one lineage against CB_post in the other, is entailed by the
  pre-edit level gap plus (ii) and so cannot distinguish survival from level; it is kept only as a
  labelled descriptive secondary. But the natural repair, a difference in differences on CB itself, has a
  FLOOR EFFECT in exactly the regime predicted here: P1 says the refusal-tuned lineage has small CB to
  begin with, and a term that starts near the null band cannot drop far, so that lineage would show a
  small change for a trivial reason and the comparison would fail or invert without bearing on the
  mechanism. The test is therefore stated on the quantity that is nonzero in BOTH lineages by
  construction: T = CB + A = s_H,haz - s_H,ben, the response-site effect measured under a harmful
  request, which is precisely the number the existing literature reports. HEADLINE (iii):
  [T_post - T_pre](SafeRL lineage) - [T_post - T_pre](Qwen3-4B lineage) exceeds a fixed margin, paired
  over items at matched request-axis damage. Nothing in P1 or P2 constrains T, only its composition, so
  this is not entailed by the supporting predictions; T is algebraically a simple difference rather than a
  sum, so it is no noisier than a main effect; and because it is the published quantity, a positive result
  says directly that the number the field reports loses different amounts in the two lineages.
  Two mechanistic tests sit underneath it and say WHY. Within the lineage whose A clears the null band
  before the edit, the FALL in A exceeds the FALL in CB, both in that checkpoint's own null-SD units --
  a comparison of two terms inside ONE checkpoint, which is where that comparison is valid, and stated on
  falls rather than on signed changes so the direction of the prediction is unambiguous. And the CB
  difference in differences is still reported, conditioned on CB_pre clearing the null band in both
  lineages, and declared UNDEFINED rather than failed where it does not. The forecast is registered
  separately and explicitly: the lineage with the SMALLER pre-edit A shows the SMALLER absolute change in
  T. That is what makes the pre-edit arming measurement a forecast of post-edit survival rather than a
  description of it.
  MATCHED DAMAGE, stated once and referred to thereafter: lineages are compared at edit strengths chosen
  so that the drop in O is equal, with each lineage's strength-to-damage curve measured first, because a
  published prompt-side result shows the edit simply biting less on resistant models, and without the
  matching a lineage would look protected merely because less was done to it.

  In words: what an abliteration leaves behind is the unarmed part, so a checkpoint whose safety was
  unarmed to begin with loses less of it. This predicts a published behavioural result -- refusal
  dropping at most 10 percent for a model trained to distribute refusal across response positions,
  against 70 to 80 points for baselines -- from an activation measurement taken BEFORE any edit. It also
  explains the community observation that some abliterated checkpoints start answering, hesitate
  mid-paragraph and talk themselves out of it, and it predicts a behavioural signature nothing published
  reports: after abliteration the gap between how a model treats hazardous text it was asked for and
  hazardous text it merely drifted into should CLOSE.

  THE WEIGHT EDIT IS A MANIPULATION, NOT AN ATTACK. It is applied in-house to localise which part of the
  signal the request axis can reach, exactly as a lesion is used to localise a function; the harvested
  public abliterated checkpoint is the community arm the request named, and the hazardous prefixes are
  teacher-forced measurement stimuli, never jailbreak attempts. Nothing in this design selects, ranks or
  optimises an attack.

  TWO SUPPORTING PREDICTIONS, each from a training objective rather than a hunch.
  (P1) Qwen3-4B, aligned by refusal-style preference tuning whose gradient signal concentrates on the
  first answer tokens, is strongly ARMED: large O, large A, small CB. It learned to decide at token one,
  so its later checking is a carried-forward consequence of that decision.
  (P2) Qwen3-4B-SafeRL is UNCONDITIONAL: large CB, small A. Its repository declares Qwen3-4B as its base
  model, so it is the instruct arm's own child and the P1-versus-P2 contrast holds pretraining and the
  refusal-tuning history fixed, isolating what the safe-completion stage added. Its reward maximises safety and helpfulness
  together while penalising unnecessary refusals, so it may not buy safety by refusing at token one; the
  only policy earning that reward is to engage and keep checking what it is emitting, whatever the
  request looked like. A sequence-level reward is the pressure that builds an always-on monitor; a
  next-token preference loss over answer prefixes is not.

  THE HARDEST THREAT, ANSWERED CAUSALLY. A base model also continues hazardous text differently from
  benign text; 2607.14147 reports the same prefill-specific collapse in a base model and calls it generic
  autoregressive conditioning. So a base model can carry a nonzero CB with no safety training, and an
  always-on monitor and plain next-token statistics produce the SAME correlational signature. Two things
  separate them. Generic conditioning has no reason to be request-dependent, so A should sit at the null
  band in the non-safety arms while CB need not, which makes A safety-specific in a way CB is not. And
  decodability is not control: the causal arm asks whether moving the harm component at response
  positions changes the model's REFUSAL DRIVE -- defined as the teacher-forced probability mass on a
  fixed refusal-onset token set at the position right after the intervened span, with the full-probe
  decision score as secondary -- and the claim is that it does so in the safety-trained checkpoints and
  not in Base. A CB that is readable but inert is a content representation; a CB that is also a
  write-handle is a monitor. That distinction is not a matter of taste: arXiv:2603.18353 reports linear
  probes reading hazard at 98.2 percent AUROC in a system that itself flags only 45 percent of the same
  hazards, a 53-point gap, with feature steering indistinguishable from a random control. That result is
  one clinical domain on one model family, so it is treated as a reason to gate rather than as a law, and
  the gate is stated on the causal arm and never on the readout alone.

  THE METRIC, AND HOW FEW PROMPTS IT REALLY NEEDS. The triple (O, CB, A) is read from ONE model's
  activations with zero generated tokens, no judge, no parent checkpoint and no benchmark. The honest
  budget is a fixed, reusable 128-text fitting battery plus k quadruples, and the design reports the
  whole learning curve at k = 4, 8, 16, 32 and 96, re-running the leave-one-family-out transfer at each
  k, so the answer to "how few prompts" is measured rather than asserted. The activations are already
  collected, so the curve is free. Validation is on TWO columns: harmful-compliance rate, the plain
  safety evaluation that was asked for, and safe-engagement rate, the fraction of harmful requests
  answered without refusing and without emitting harmful content, on which no cheap internal metric has
  ever been validated and which a blanket refuser cannot win.

motivation: |-
  1. THE MEASUREMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROPERTY AND AN AVERAGE, AND THAT IS THE PART THAT
  CHANGES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. If A is large, the response-site effect the literature reports is an
  average over a request factor nobody varied. It is then not a per-model property at all but a property
  of the model crossed with the harmful-request setting it was measured in. Two checkpoints with
  identical published response-site effects can behave completely differently the moment the request
  stops looking dangerous -- which is the regime that matters in long generations, multi-turn use and
  agentic tool loops, where the hazardous text a model is continuing was often not requested by anybody.
  This claim is publishable whichever way the checkpoints fall, and it costs 1,280 forward passes to
  settle for a given model.

  2. THE MISRANKING THE METRIC IS MEANT TO FIX IS DOCUMENTED, NOT ASSUMED. Internal harmfulness scores
  read at prompt-dependent locations have been reported to ANTI-rank successful jailbreaks, at AUROC
  0.220 among wrapped harmful prompts, meaning successful attacks rank LOWER than failed ones. That is
  independent published evidence that the standard cheap readout measures the wrong thing. The
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL card is the clean instance: in NON-THINK mode its safety rate rises 64.7 to 98.1 on
  WildGuard while its refusal rate FALLS 12.9 to 5.3, and on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge the same rows
  read 47.5 to 86.5. Both columns are quoted deliberately: 98.1 is near ceiling so the WildGuard column
  overstates headroom, and in THINK mode refusal barely moves, 6.5 to 6.2, so the argument that SafeRL
  cannot buy safety by refusing at token one is scoped to the non-think setting this study runs in.
  Every cheap readout in use -- first-token refusal probability, refusal-direction projection at the last
  prompt token, activation cluster separation, refusal rate -- reads the request-side gate, which is
  exactly the component this kind of training turns down.

  3. THE PRACTICAL ADVICE IS ALREADY PROVEN AND IS NOT CLAIMED; THE MECHANISM IS WHAT IS MISSING. A
  published defence trains on justify-then-refuse responses that distribute the refusal signal across
  token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under abliteration against 70 to 80
  point drops for baselines, with a feature-space section showing the edit shrinking the harmful-versus-
  benign PROMPT centroid distance far less in those models, 10.0 / 7.7 / 13.7 against 28.8 / 33.9 / 28.7.
  So "put safety where a prompt-fitted rank-one edit cannot see" is known, and that paper measures the
  request axis at the prompt in models built to resist. What is missing is a measurement at RESPONSE
  positions that separates the request-gated part from the request-independent part, and a checkpoint
  that was not designed to resist. The claim is that the mechanism is the arming term, and that a model
  trained for something else entirely -- safe completion -- shows the same protective structure with
  nobody having built it in. Those same numbers are also why the surviving-monitor comparison is made at
  matched request-axis damage.
assumptions:
- >-
  The internal safety signal is linearly readable at generated positions and not only at the decision token. This is established
  rather than assumed: streaming hidden-state moderation probes decode the harmfulness of a partially written response throughout
  generation, and arXiv:2607.14147 reads the harm direction at response positions with a causal effect. The readout used here
  is a difference-in-means axis fitted on a DISJOINT corpus of hazardous versus benign continuations at response positions,
  benchmarked against a cross-validated linear probe and against raw hidden vectors, with the cross-fitted variant over the
  evaluation items retained as a robustness row.
- >-
  The response-content harm axis is not collinear with the direction abliteration removes. This is the load-bearing instrument
  assumption and it is measured rather than asserted: r_content is fitted at RESPONSE positions on a continuation contrast
  under a held-fixed request, where the abliteration direction is fitted at the last PROMPT token on a request contrast, and
  |cos| between them is a pre-registered Stage-2 gate at 0.50 backed by a component-preservation diagnostic. If the gate fails,
  the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue and are reported as one, with the arm carried by the per-checkpoint
  refit and the full probe. Two further measurement facts sit in the same assumption. Standard abliteration edits only matrices
  that write to the residual stream, using a direction estimated at prompt positions, which is what makes the headline a structural
  prediction rather than a guess; recipes that fit at response positions or re-train after editing would break it and are
  analysed as a separate stratum, never pooled. And cross-checkpoint terms are only comparable after standardisation, because
  residual-stream norms and LayerNorm gains differ between base, instruct, RL-tuned and weight-edited checkpoints and move
  again under the edit, so every cross-checkpoint quantity is expressed in that checkpoint's own measured null-band per-item
  SD with the raw-scale table published alongside.
- >-
  The request factor and the response factor can be varied independently over the same strings, so the interaction is estimable.
  Four cells share one continuation vocabulary and one token span. The threat is that the off-diagonal cells are incoherent
  continuations while the diagonals are coherent, loading a generic instruction-mismatch signal onto exactly the term the
  headline is stated in. This is neither assumed away nor handled by a constant subtraction: a safety-irrelevant crossed control
  of the same shape estimates the coherence interaction, both crossings are calibrated on the model's own log-probability
  of the prefix given the request, and where the mismatch magnitudes do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty
  and the arming term reported net of the covariate, or as an upper bound if the control's mismatch cannot be raised to the
  treatment's.
- >-
  A response-conditioned safety signal is not the same thing as generic autoregressive conditioning, and the two are separable
  by their dependence on the request and by whether they steer. Generic conditioning should produce a response main effect
  with no request modulation. This is the load-bearing scientific assumption behind treating A rather than CB as the safety
  term, and it is tested by two pre-registered non-safety arms -- Qwen3-4B-Base and a non-safety fine-tune of the same parent
  -- plus the causal requirement that the component be a write-handle and not merely readable.
- >-
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL's safety-up, refusal-down profile reflects a genuine safe-completion policy rather than a fixed hedging
  template that keyword refusal detectors miss. A quantitative template-collapse diagnostic runs before the second supporting
  prediction is interpreted: distinct-3-gram rate of SafeRL non-refusals at least 0.6 times that of Qwen3-4B non-refusals,
  and cross-request response similarity at least 0.15 below within-request similarity, both thresholds fixed before the run.

    non-safety fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base  non-safety arm 2; ladder below
    + in-house edited grid: 5 strengths x {Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL}
    NOT USED: huihui-ai/Qwen3-4B-abliterated, whose repo is gated 'auto' and whose config cannot be read
    without authentication; mlabonne is the ungated community arm.

  NON-SAFETY FINE-TUNE LADDER, in order, fixed now so the arm cannot be chosen after Base is seen:
    (1) an ungated, non-quantised third-party fine-tune whose parent is DECLARED as Qwen3-4B-Base in the
        repo metadata, not merely implied by its name, and which ships the stock Qwen chat template so
        that token spans match the other arms exactly. Verified live on 2026-09-20 and ordered by those
        two criteria: CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.03.01_1e-6 first, a hint-generation SFT run with
        an explicit base_model tag and the stock 4,116-byte Qwen template; then
        CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.04.00_1e-6_no_think, same family; then
        shjondhale/AzureML-Qwen3-4B-Base-GRPO, a math GRPO run with an explicit base_model tag but a
        custom 1,991-byte template, which costs span comparability and is therefore ranked below the
        first two. HikariLight/Qwen3_4B_Base__COMP_ACI_DAMT_SFT_Merged is live and ungated and carries
        the stock template, but its repo declares no base_model at all, so its parentage rests on its
        name; it is a last resort within this rung and would be reported with that caveat.
    (2) failing all three, an in-house LoRA or short full fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base on an ungated
        non-safety instruction set -- hours of GPU time at 4B, and it holds parent, tokenizer and
        template exactly fixed, which the cross-family option does not;
    (3) only failing both, a non-safety fine-tune of another family's parent, and then only under the
        standardized null-SD units.
    Any third-party fine-tune differs from the instruct checkpoint in instruction-following ability and
    in chat template as well as in safety training; that is a stated confound, the arm's chat template is
    reported next to its results, and it is why rung (2) is preferred over rung (3).

  READOUT DIRECTION r_content, stated completely because this is what decides whether Stage 2 measures
  anything: difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATION tokens, taken at RESPONSE
  positions, over a fitting corpus of 64 continuation pairs written under a single held-fixed, neutral
  request, disjoint from the 96 evaluation scenarios. It is therefore a different vector from the
  abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the
  last PROMPT token. A fully disjoint fitting corpus is stronger than cross-fitting over the evaluation
  items, not weaker: it removes in-sample selection entirely rather than rotating it, and the
  cross-fitted variant over the 96 scenarios is retained as a robustness row.

  LAYER BAND: a contiguous band of 25% of the network's layers (9 of 36), expressed as a FRACTION OF
  NETWORK DEPTH so it transfers to any architecture, chosen at Stage 0 as the band maximising the continuation-contrast
  positive control in Qwen3-4B, computed on the FITTING CORPUS ONLY and never on the evaluation
  scenarios, then frozen for all checkpoints. Secondary, pre-registered: a per-checkpoint BEST-BAND
  search, Holm-corrected, against which the safety-specificity gate must also hold.

  RESPONSE-POSITION WINDOWS: continuation tokens 5-20 (EARLY, primary) and 40-55 (LATE), both read from
  one forward pass over a continuation of at least 64 tokens, so the position curve costs nothing.

  ITEMS: 96 confirmatory scenarios plus a 54-scenario HELD-OUT REPLICATION set, split at random before
  any activations are collected. The supply was checked rather than assumed: XSTest v2 ships 450 prompts,
  250 safe across 10 types and 200 unsafe contrast across 8 types, and in 6 of those contrast families --
  homonyms, safe targets, safe contexts, definitions, figurative language and historical events -- the
  safe and unsafe rows are genuine minimal-edit twins, 25 each, giving 150 tightly matched pairs. The
  remaining two contrast families, discrimination and privacy, are only topically parallel and are
  excluded. So 96 is a power-driven choice out of 150 available pairs and the leftover 54 become a real
  replication set rather than a subsample; OR-Bench (80,359 / 1,319 / 655 rows across its three configs)
  is available if a domain needs topping up. Two prefix families per scenario, generated mechanically
  from two fixed templates: F1 ANNOUNCED, where the continuation opens by naming what it is about to do,
  and F2 ENACTED, where it simply performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement.

  FORWARD-PASS BUDGET: 96 items x (4 safety cells x 2 families + 4 coherence cells) + 128 fitting-corpus
  passes = 1,280 per model state; 15 model states = 19,200 passes. The 54-item held-out replication runs
  on the five checkpoints only, adding 3,240. Total about 22,400 forward passes of at most 320 tokens
  with zero generated tokens: minutes to low tens of minutes of GPU time, which is why the item count is
  set by power and not by compute.

  REFUSAL DRIVE, the dependent variable of the causal arm and of the CB half of the specificity gate,
  defined here because a gate cannot be evaluated against an undefined outcome. PRIMARY: the teacher-
  forced probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the
  intervened span. It is well defined in Base, needs no decision label, and is the quantity the published
  0.24-versus-0.03 routing-concentration figure speaks to. SECONDARY: the cross-validated full-probe
  decision score, trained on Qwen3-4B and applied unchanged to Base, with that transfer flagged. Both are
  output-side READOUTS of an activation-side INTERVENTION, which is what the commissioned invariant
  permits; the deployed metric itself stays activation-only and never uses them.

  EDIT-STRENGTH GRID: five strengths per lineage, spanning zero to the strength at which O collapses,
  with the primary comparison read off each lineage's own O-damage curve by interpolation.

  STAGE 0 -- INSTRUMENT, ITEMS AND GATES, ALL BEFORE ANY EXPENSIVE WORK.
  Build the 64-pair fitting corpus and fit r_content. Check split-half cosine >= 0.70 in every
  checkpoint; below it, the fitting corpus is enlarged before Stage 1 rather than after effects are seen.
  RUN THE POWER CHECK HERE TOO, not only the direction check: on a 24-item pilot subset, estimate r, the
  ratio of the per-item SD of A to the per-item null SD, and recompute the MDE for every row of the
  criteria table at the planned n. If the achieved r implies an MDE above any registered threshold, the
  scenario count is raised toward the 150 available pairs BEFORE the confirmatory run, and the pilot items
  are excluded from the held-out set. The escape hatch is conditional on this check and on the split-half
  cosine, and the achieved r is reported either way, so a reader can see what the design could and could
  not have detected.
  Choose the layer band on fitting-corpus data only and freeze it as a fraction of network depth. Build 96 twin
  scenarios from XSTest's safe split topped up from OR-Bench, and generate both prefix families
  mechanically from two fixed templates, publishing all cells verbatim. Gates: (a) an external judge
  labels twins and prefixes correctly at a stated rate; (b) a positive control that r_content separates
  hazardous from benign continuations in Qwen3-4B; (c) a PLACEBO prefix factor at the same lexical
  distance, tested for equivalence within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST, whose attainability is shown above;
  (d) null bands from at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the ENTIRE
  pipeline including the direction fit, which is also what defines the null-SD unit; (e) the NLL-MATCH
  DIAGNOSTIC described next.

  THE COHERENCE CONTROL IS CALIBRATED, NOT ASSUMED. Subtracting the coherence interaction from the safety
  interaction is only valid if the generic instruction-mismatch signal enters additively and if the two
  crossings produce mismatches of comparable magnitude -- and a benign request followed by an off-topic
  benign prefix is a mild non-sequitur where a benign request followed by a hazardous prefix is a severe
  one. The calibration costs nothing because it comes from the same forward passes: the model's own mean
  token log-probability of the PREFIX given the REQUEST. The four-cell log-probability table is reported
  for BOTH 2x2s as a mandatory Stage-0 diagnostic, and the off-diagonal penalty in the coherence crossing
  must be statistically indistinguishable from, or larger than, the penalty in the safety crossing before
  any subtraction is performed. If they do not match, nothing constant is subtracted: the per-item
  readout is regressed on the per-item log-probability penalty across all cells and A_net is reported as
  the coefficient net of that covariate, which survives both a magnitude mismatch and mild
  non-additivity. If the coherence penalty cannot be brought up to the safety penalty at all, A_net is
  reported as an UPPER BOUND on arming rather than as an estimate, and labelled that way everywhere.

  STAGE 1 IS THE COMMISSIONED DELIVERABLE: THE ACTIVATION-LEVEL COMPARISON. Five checkpoints, each loaded
  alone on the 20 GB card, with the F32 community checkpoint cast to bf16 on load and that cast recorded
  as a stated deviation. The 54-scenario held-out set is run here too, on these five only, and its
  estimates are sealed until the confirmatory analysis is complete. For every layer and every position in the frozen window, produce maps of O, CB
  and A in all five, with item-clustered bootstrap intervals and per-item distributions rather than means
  alone, in both raw and null-SD units, under BOTH prefix families and BOTH response-position windows. The base
  protocol is stated rather than left to formatting: Base is run twice, once with the Qwen3-4B chat
  template applied verbatim so token spans match across checkpoints and once in plain completion format,
  and the two must agree qualitatively before Base is used as a control, because alignment is reported to
  concentrate in the assistant header tokens and those tokens are out of distribution for Base.
  The RESPONSE-POSITION curve, A in the early window against A in the late window, is reported as a
  result in its own right: it separates an arming term that persists from a shallow-alignment transient
  at one position, which a single frozen window cannot do, and it is free because both windows come from
  the same forward pass.

  THE CAUSAL ARM USES THE RUNG THAT SURVIVES. Not full-residual patching: that restores refusal to 100
  percent at every layer, but so does patching the mean BENIGN residual at the same position, so the
  intervention is generic disruption and a random-direction control cannot detect the failure because the
  benign patch is the treatment. Instead add or remove ONLY the r_content component at response
  positions, at layer cells fixed at Stage 0, against a matched-norm control direction ORTHOGONALIZED to
  it, with full-residual patching retained and labelled as a positive control that the intervention did
  something. Report collateral disruption on already-correct benign cases and the per-item effect
  distribution, never a mean at one coefficient.

  STAGE 2 BUILDS THE MISSING CHECKPOINT AND TESTS THE HEADLINE. No abliterated safe-completion model
  exists, so one pinned rank-one orthogonalisation with the direction estimated at prompt positions is
  applied to BOTH Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-4B-SafeRL across a five-strength grid. Minutes of GPU time, no
  training, recipe held fixed, so a difference between lineages is attributable to safety-training style
  rather than to the tool -- the confound that wrecks comparisons across harvested community checkpoints.
  Stage 2 measures each lineage's O-damage curve first, then makes the primary comparison at the
  pre-registered matched-damage level by interpolation. The annihilation gate and the
  component-preservation diagnostic are evaluated here, before any term is interpreted. The harvested
  public abliteration is an external check that the in-house edit reproduces a real one, and each
  lineage's pre-edit A is recorded before the edit so post-edit survival is a forecast, not a fit.

  STAGE 3 COLLECTS BEHAVIOURAL GROUND TRUTH ON BOTH COLUMNS. For the five checkpoints, the in-house
  edits, and a panel of ungated checkpoints at or below 4B spanning at least SIX families -- families,
  not checkpoints, are the clustering unit -- measure harmful-compliance rate, over-refusal on hard
  benign twins, and safe-engagement rate, graded by a fixed rubric through an OpenRouter judge. Budget
  planned before the sweep at roughly 4,000 to 6,000 graded responses, near 3 to 5 US dollars against the
  10 dollar cap, with the running total checked after every batch and the sweep stopped on approach.

  STAGE 4 ASKS WHETHER THE PROFILE PREDICTS ANYTHING, ON TWO CO-PRIMARY COLUMNS AND AT FIVE PROMPT
  BUDGETS. Leave-one-family-out prediction with no recalibration, of harmful-compliance rate and of
  safe-engagement rate, from (O, CB, A), against baselines prior work says are hard to beat: the
  model-card and repository-name regex, black-box greedy refusal rate, first-token refusal logit gap,
  activation cluster separation, raw hidden vectors as the non-featurized control, and -- added because it
  is the only published family competing on the same axis -- a NON-GENERATIVE LATENT SAFETY EVALUATOR from
  the recent line that scores safety from a checkpoint's latent representations without sampling any text.
  Where such a method has a usable implementation it is run on the same panel; where it does not, its
  reported numbers on any overlapping checkpoints are tabulated beside ours and the comparison is labelled
  indirect. Those methods read the request side and return a scalar, so the claim here is specifically
  that a profile separating the request term from the unconditional response term and their interaction
  beats a scalar on the safe-engagement column, which is exactly where a request-side scalar should fail.
  The decision rule
  is fixed so a coin cannot pass it: the profile must beat the STRONGEST baseline on at least 5 of 6
  families, which a fair coin passes 10.9 percent of the time where a bare majority of six passes 34
  percent, AND the paired family-clustered interval must exclude zero. The same evaluation is repeated at
  k = 4, 8, 16, 32 and 96 quadruples and the smallest k that still passes is reported as the headline
  prompt budget. Both outcomes are informative: if the profile fails to transfer, Stages 1 and 2 stand as
  a mechanism result on the commissioned trio and the failure localises which term refuses to generalise.

  RELEASED ARTEFACTS, because the coordinate is only reusable if the stimuli are: all 768 safety cells
  (96 scenarios x 4 cells x 2 families), all 384 coherence cells, the 128-text fitting battery, the
  fitted directions, the per-item four-cell scalars and the full layer-by-position maps for every
  checkpoint. The nearest existing artefact collects answer-position activations for the same trio but is
  gated, has no counterfactual factor and carries no analysis, so an ungated crossed one is an
  independent contribution.

  FEASIBILITY, VERIFIED THIS SESSION. NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20 GB VRAM, 48 cores, 251 GB RAM; the Qwen3-4B
  checkpoints ungated and downloadable. Stage 1 is 19,200 hooked forward passes with zero generated
  tokens, minutes to low tens of minutes; Stage 2 is a rank-one weight edit. The binding costs are panel
  downloads, streamed one checkpoint at a time, and the Stage 3 judge calls, budgeted above.
success_criteria: |-
  CRITERIA TABLE. Every threshold is a NUMBER, in null-SD units, fixed now. Planning arithmetic, shown
  once and used for every row: the null-SD unit is the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast
  computed under >=20 random unit directions in that checkpoint, so it is n-independent and carries that
  checkpoint's own residual-stream scale. The standard error of a standardized term is r/sqrt(n) where
  r = (per-item SD of the real term)/(per-item null SD); we plan at r = 1.2 and n = 96 scenarios, giving
  SE = 0.123, and report the achieved r. Derived MDEs at n=96: simple term 0.24; two-checkpoint
  difference 0.34; pre/post difference-in-differences 0.48; TOST half-width at 90% 0.20; coherence-net A
  0.25 to 0.34 depending on the covariate R-squared. At n=24 those same numbers are 0.48 / 0.68 / 0.96 /
  0.40, which is why 24 items was abandoned: the difference-in-differences that carries the headline would
  have had a minimum detectable effect of 0.96 null-SD, larger than any margin worth setting. The item
  count is therefore set by this arithmetic and not by what the twin sets happen to yield -- 150 matched
  XSTest pairs exist, 96 are used for the confirmatory analysis and the remaining 54 become a held-out
  replication set whose own two-checkpoint MDE is 0.45.

  CONFIRMS the hypothesis. Every threshold is the NUMBER in the criteria table; nulls are measured from
  at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the whole pipeline including the
  direction fit, never from a nominal chance value.
  - SAFETY-SPECIFICITY GATE, which must pass before any term is called safety, registered PER CHECKPOINT
    before the run so no term is chosen after the fact: Qwen3-4B on A, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL on CB. Each must
    exceed BOTH non-safety arms on its registered term by 0.50 null-SD with item-clustered intervals
    excluding zero, in the frozen band AND against each non-safety arm's Holm-corrected BEST band, so a
    null in a non-safety arm that disappears under the best-band search is reported as a band artefact
    rather than as specificity. Because a base model can carry a readable CB from generic autoregressive
    conditioning alone, the CB half additionally requires the CAUSAL arm: moving the r_content component
    at response positions must change the refusal drive in the safety-trained checkpoint and not in Base,
    against the orthogonalized control. A term that is readable but inert does not pass.
  - COHERENCE-NET ARMING: A_net exceeds 0.40 null-SD with an interval excluding zero in the checkpoint
    registered on A. This applies to A wherever A is claimed and nowhere else: SafeRL is predicted to have
    A near zero, so a null A_net there confirms P2 rather than failing this gate, and the two are
    distinguished by which term each checkpoint was registered on before the run.
  - TEMPLATE GENERALITY: the arming ordering holds under BOTH prefix families, announced and enacted. A
    result present only under the announced family is a property of the announcement, not of the content,
    and is reported as such.
  - ORDERING: A(Qwen3-4B) - A(SafeRL) > 0.50 null-SD and CB(SafeRL) - CB(Qwen3-4B) > 0.50 null-SD, paired,
    intervals excluding zero. The refusal-tuned model's output monitoring is armed by the request; the
    safe-completion model's runs unconditionally.
  - HEADLINE, at the matched-damage level and with no denominator anywhere: (i) post-edit A is equivalent
    to the null band within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST in BOTH lineages; (ii) post-edit CB exceeds 0.40
    null-SD in every lineage where it exceeded it before; (iii) the difference in differences on
    T = CB + A, the published response-site effect under a harmful request,
    [T_post-T_pre](SafeRL) - [T_post-T_pre](Qwen3-4B), exceeds 0.60 null-SD, paired and item-clustered.
    (iii) carries the claim, and it is stated as a CHANGE in T rather than as a level in CB for two
    separate reasons: a post-edit level comparison is entailed by the pre-edit gap plus (ii), and a
    change in CB has a floor in the very lineage P1 predicts to have little CB to lose. T is nonzero in
    both lineages by construction, so it has neither problem. Underneath it, 7b: writing drop_X = X_pre - X_post so that a
    positive drop means the term fell, then within the lineage whose A clears the null band before the
    edit, drop_A exceeds drop_CB by 0.35 null-SD in that checkpoint's own units; and 7c: the CB difference in differences, reported only where CB_pre clears the null band in
    both lineages and declared UNDEFINED otherwise rather than counted as a failure. If no pair of
    strengths gives matched O damage, the criterion fails and is reported unmet rather than relaxed.
  - FORECAST: the lineage with the smaller pre-edit A shows the smaller absolute change in T, with both
    change intervals excluding zero. This is what makes the pre-edit measurement predictive rather than
    descriptive, and it is registered as its own criterion rather than left in prose.
  - CAUSAL: at fixed layer cells, adding or removing the r_content component at response positions moves
    the refusal drive more than a matched-norm orthogonalized control, with the per-item distribution
    reported, and the size of that effect tracks CB across checkpoints.
  - DOUBLE DISSOCIATION, the strongest single form the result can take: safe-completion training raises
    CB and not A; the prompt-fitted weight edit lowers A and not CB, same recipe, both lineages. No single
    scalar of safety strength can produce that pattern, so if both halves hold with intervals excluding
    zero the two terms are separately real.
  - INSTRUMENT INTEGRITY: |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| at most 0.50 and the edited model's variance along
    r_content at least 0.25 times the median variance along 20 matched-norm random directions. If either
    fails, the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue, are labelled one, and the arm
    is reported only under refit and full-probe readouts.
  - STABILITY AND REPLICATION: every reported term carries its distribution over bootstrap resamples,
    at least three probe-set subsamples and both prefix families, and a term whose sign is not stable
    across those draws is reported as unstable rather than as an effect. Beyond resampling, the two
    ordering criteria and the coherence-net arming criterion are re-run once on the 54-scenario HELD-OUT
    set, which is split off before any activations are collected; the ordering must hold there in sign,
    with the held-out estimate reported whether or not it does.
  - METRIC PAYOFF: under leave-one-family-out with no recalibration, (O, CB, A) beats the strongest
    baseline on at least 5 of 6 families with a paired family-clustered interval excluding zero, on BOTH
    co-primary columns or on safe-engagement with an honest report of the harmful-compliance result either
    way; and the prompt-budget curve names the smallest k in {4, 8, 16, 32, 96} at which that still holds.

  DISCONFIRMS it, stated so the run cannot be rescued afterwards.
  - THE CHEAPEST KILL, checked at Stage 1 before any judge spend: if A is inside the null band in EVERY
    checkpoint, the arming coordinate is empty, output monitoring where it exists is unconditional, and
    the headline is dead. The run then reports a single response-site term, says plainly that
    arXiv:2607.14147 already owns it, and reports the methodological claim as refuted for this family --
    which is itself the answer to the question asked, not a rebranding.
  - If A and CB are BOTH inside the null band everywhere there is no response-site signal in this family
    under this readout, which would contradict published work and is first treated as instrument failure.
  - If A is as large in Base or in the non-safety fine-tune as in the safety-trained checkpoints, A is a
    fact about autoregressive conditioning, not about safety, and the interpretation is withdrawn.
  - If the NLL-match gate fails and the covariate regression still leaves the safety interaction fully
    explained by the mismatch penalty, the headline term is instruction-mismatch and is reported as such.
  - If CB is readable but r_content is not a write-handle in any safety-trained checkpoint, the monitor
    reading is withdrawn: what was measured is a content representation, the correlational maps stand, the
    causal claim does not.
  - If SafeRL's A is at or above Qwen3-4B's, or its CB at or below, the training-objective argument behind
    P2 is wrong. That is a real finding about safe-completion training and is reported as a refutation.
  - If the edit drives CB into the null band as well as A, or if the T difference in differences comes
    back null or reversed at matched damage, the blind-spot argument is wrong: the two terms share a write
    bottleneck and a prompt-estimated rank-one edit reaches both. If it leaves A above the
    null band, the request-axis fitting argument is wrong in the other direction.
  - If the annihilation gate fails -- |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| above 0.50, or the edited model's variance
    along r_content at floor against the random-direction reference -- then the parent-fixed post-edit
    numbers measure a deleted coordinate rather than a model property, and the Stage-2 headline is
    WITHDRAWN under that basis rather than reported. The arm then carries only what the per-checkpoint
    refit and the full probe support, and if those disagree the honest output is that this design cannot
    settle post-edit survival, which is a stated limit rather than a softened claim. Stages 1 and 3 are
    unaffected, because neither depends on the edited checkpoints.
  - If the arming ordering holds under one prefix family and reverses under the other, A is a property of
    that template and is reported as a template effect, not a checkpoint property.
  - If the template-collapse diagnostic fires, P2 is uninterpretable and must be restated about templates
    rather than controllers.
  - REPORTING RULE, stated once. Every pass-or-fail test takes one of four permitted forms: an absolute
    main effect; the same term compared across two checkpoints; a change in one term, or a difference of
    such changes across checkpoints; or, in exactly one place, a difference between the CHANGES in two
    different terms INSIDE one checkpoint (criterion 7b), which is permitted because both changes are
    expressed in that one checkpoint's own null-SD units and no scale travels between models. None is a
    ratio between two different main effects and none is a share. The descriptive arming fraction A/(CB+A) is reported only where CB+A clears the
    null band, is labelled UNDEFINED elsewhere, and never decides anything. No statistic in this design is
    computable only when the hypothesis is true, and each disconfirming outcome names a quantity that is
    well defined in the world where the hypothesis fails. Equivalence claims use two one-sided tests with
    the margins above, whose attainability is shown arithmetically at n=96; the robustness grid carries
    Holm correction; no criterion is set at the minimum count that would pass it.

  arXiv:2607.14147, Kwon, 'Breaking Refusal in the First Half: A Mechanistic Study of the Prefill Jailbreak' (14 Jul 2026)
  -- THE NEAREST PRIOR WORK and the constraint this design is built around. It holds the request harmful, varies the content
  of the model's own response, reads the harm direction at response positions and concludes that refusal is 'a shallow, response-site
  computation'. That pathway is conceded entirely and is not claimed here. Its pre-registered 2x2 is harm x SURFACE trigger
  density (AdvBench-scary/clean x XSTest-safe/Alpaca) run in the plain condition, never crossed with the prefill factor, and
  it contains no benign-twin construction; the nearest thing to the arming term is a 24-prompt specificity control inside
  one intervention arm, a behavioural difference-in-differences of +16.8 points (harmful refusal 3 to 24 percent, benign 0
  to 4 percent) reported as a check that an attention knockout was harm-specific -- behavioural rather than activation-level,
  unmatched rather than twinned, attached to an intervention rather than to a readout. It produces no per-checkpoint summary
  and contains no abliterated, weight-edited, safe-completion or safety-RL checkpoint; its panel is Qwen2.5-0.5B to 7B, SmolLM2-1.7B,
  Phi-3-mini-3.8B and Phi-3-medium-14B with Qwen2.5 base controls. Three of its findings are adopted rather than rediscovered:
  the full-residual patch is dropped because the benign-residual control also returns refusal to 100 percent at every layer;
  the single refusal direction is demoted because the diff-of-means readout ceilings at AUC 0.727 while a full probe reads
  about 0.85, with SmolLM2 a single-direction counterexample; and its base-model result is treated as the central threat,
  including the detail that most supports this design -- the instruct model routes the same signal to refusal tokens about
  8 times more than the base model does, concentration 0.24 against 0.03, which is exactly the readable-but-inert versus write-handle
  distinction the causal gate is built on.

  responses that distribute the refusal signal across token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under
  abliteration against 70 to 80 point drops for baselines. It owns the practical recommendation, which is why that recommendation
  is not claimed as new. It is not purely behavioural: its feature-space section runs PCA on final hidden states of harmful
  and benign PROMPTS and reports abliteration shrinking the centroid distance by 28.8, 33.9 and 28.7 points in standard models
  against 10.0, 7.7 and 13.7 in extended-refusal models. That is a REQUEST-axis measurement at the prompt, with no response-position
  readout, no decomposition into request and response terms and no causal intervention -- and it is the direct source of the
  matched-damage requirement in this design, since it shows the edit is globally less effective on such models. The remaining
  contribution here is the mechanism, small arming plus an unconditional monitor, and the prediction that a checkpoint trained
  for safe completion shows the same protective structure although nobody built it in, which a deliberately constructed defence
  cannot demonstrate.

  methodological choice, cited by identifier rather than by description. Linear probes on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct's internal representations
  discriminate hazardous from benign cases at 98.2 percent AUROC while the model itself flags only 65 of 144 hazards, 45 percent,
  a 53-point gap; sparse-autoencoder feature steering produced zero corrections and zero disruptions, identical to its random-feature
  control, and concept-bottleneck steering was indistinguishable from random perturbation. That is why the safety-specificity
  gate here is stated on the CAUSAL arm and never on the readout alone: a readable component is not a write-handle. The scope
  caveat is stated rather than hidden -- one clinical triage domain, 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes, two models -- so
  it motivates the gate without being treated as a universal law.

  positions, at the instruction token and just after it, and never touches activations over generated text. Its split is therefore

  own the read-rank versus write-rank question, also screened and abandoned. They matter because they predict that a rank-one
  edit is an incomplete write-handle, which is why this design pre-registers the parent-fixed basis, publishes cos(r_parent,
  r_child), and adds the component-preservation diagnostic instead of assuming the edited model is measured in the same coordinates
  as its parent.
inspiration: |-
  The framing came from control engineering and the ESTIMAND came from epidemiology, and it is the second
  import that does the work.

  Control engineering supplies the vocabulary: a controller is open-loop when its action is computed once
  from the reference input, closed-loop when it is recomputed from the plant's own measured output. In an
  autoregressive model the plant output is literally the text already emitted, re-read at every step
  through self-attention, so the distinction is available rather than analogical. That framing alone was
  not enough, because the closed-loop pathway turned out to be published. A borrowed frame earns nothing
  if the thing it names has already been measured.

  What rescued it was effect modification, the epidemiologist's discipline about interactions.
  Epidemiology takes as basic that a treatment effect averaged over a modifier is not a property of the
  treatment, and that the interaction is often the scientifically interesting quantity rather than a
  nuisance to control away. Applied here that is an indictment: the published response-site effect is
  measured only under harmful requests, so it is an effect at one level of an unvaried modifier, and
  whether the request MODIFIES it has not been asked. That turns a missing cell into a real quantity --
  is the monitor armed or always on -- and it is the quantity the abliteration argument actually bears
  on, since an edit fitted on the request axis should remove a request-dependent gate and not a
  request-independent monitor. Epidemiology supplied the discipline that came with it too: an interaction
  is only interpretable against a control for whatever else distinguishes the off-diagonal cells, which
  is why the crossed non-safety control is part of the design rather than an afterthought -- and, in this
  revision, why that control is CALIBRATED on the model's own prefix log-probability before anything is
  subtracted, since an interaction control that produces a milder mismatch than the treatment cells
  under-subtracts by exactly the amount that would manufacture the headline.

  Two smaller imports remain. From experimental psychology, the factorial logic that separating two
  confounded causes requires varying each independently over the same materials: reading safety at one
  token position is a one-cell design and the fix is the other three cells. From reliability engineering,
  the observation that a two-barrier system fails as though it had one barrier when a single fault removes
  both, which is what made the fitting-set argument load-bearing rather than a curiosity. This revision
  adds a third, from measurement theory: a quantity is only comparable across instruments if it is
  expressed in units the instrument itself defines, which is why every cross-checkpoint term is now read
  in that checkpoint's own measured null-band scale instead of in raw residual-stream units.

  The negative screening mattered as much. Five mechanisms were built and abandoned in an earlier
  iteration because their core already exists: attention-side versus write-side dissociation, the
  read-rank versus write-rank funnel, mutational robustness of refusal under weight noise, a
  recognition-versus-enforcement two-axis profile, and a common-cause-failure concentration score. A
  sixth was abandoned next -- the bare closed-loop main effect, which arXiv:2607.14147 owns causally --
  and the question was kept by moving to the term that paper's design cannot reach.
terms:
- term: Published response-site effect (T)
  definition: >-
    T = CB + A = s_H,haz - s_H,ben: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text appears in the model's own
    output under a HARMFUL request. It is algebraically a simple difference, it is the quantity existing response-site work
    reports, and it is nonzero in every safety-trained checkpoint by construction. That last property is why the headline
    survival test is stated as a change in T: a change in CB alone would have a floor in the lineage predicted to have little
    CB to lose, and a post-edit level comparison would be entailed by the pre-edit gap.
- term: Arming (A)
  definition: >-
    The interaction term of the 2x2: how much MORE a model's internal safety signal reacts to hazardous text it has already
    written when the request was harmful than when the request was a matched benign twin. Large A means an output monitor
    the request switches on; A near zero means one that is always on. It is the headline quantity because it is the part of
    the response-conditioned signal that a base model's generic autoregressive conditioning does not predict.
- term: Unconditional output monitoring (CB)
  definition: >-
    The response main effect measured under the BENIGN request: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text
    appears in the model's own output although nothing in the request called for it. Never used alone as evidence of safety,
    because a non-safety-tuned model can have a nonzero CB from next-token statistics alone, which is why the CB half of the
    specificity gate requires the causal arm.
- term: Open-loop strength (O)
  definition: >-
    The request main effect: how much the internal safety signal differs between a harmful request and its matched benign
    twin, averaged over both response prefixes. This is the component every standard cheap readout measures, and the component
    a prompt-fitted weight edit is fitted on. It is also the axis along which the two lineages are matched for edit damage
    before any survival comparison is made.
- term: Effect modification
  definition: >-
    The epidemiological name for a situation in which the effect of one factor depends on the level of another. Its methodological
    consequence is imported directly: where modification is present, a main effect averaged over the modifier is not a property
    of the system, so a response-site effect measured only under harmful requests cannot be read as a per-model property.
- term: Response-content harm axis (r_content)
  definition: >-
    The primary readout direction: a difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATIONS taken at RESPONSE token
    positions, under one held-fixed neutral request, on a fitting corpus disjoint from the evaluation items. It is deliberately
    a different vector from the abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS
    at the last PROMPT token. Their cosine is a pre-registered gate, because if the two coincided the weight edit would delete
    the measurement coordinate and every post-edit number would be an algebraic residue rather than a fact about safety.
- term: Null-SD unit
  definition: >-
    The unit every cross-checkpoint comparison is reported in: the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast computed
    under at least 20 random unit directions in that same checkpoint. It is independent of the item count and it carries that
    checkpoint's own residual-stream and LayerNorm scale, which raw projections do not, so it is what makes a term measured
    in a base model, an RL-tuned model and a weight-edited model the same quantity.
- term: Refusal drive
  definition: >-
    The dependent variable of the causal arm, and of the CB half of the safety-specificity gate. PRIMARY: the teacher-forced
    probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the intervened span, which is well
    defined in a base model and needs no decision label. SECONDARY: a cross-validated full-probe decision score trained on
    the instruct model and applied unchanged elsewhere. It is an output-side readout of an activation-side intervention; the
    deployed metric never uses it.
- term: Coherence control, and its calibration
  definition: >-
    A second 2x2 of the same shape over the same items in which a safety-irrelevant attribute is crossed the same way: a benign
    request about topic A or B, crossed with a benign prefix about topic A or B. It estimates the generic instruction-mismatch
    interaction that would otherwise be indistinguishable from arming. Subtracting it is only licensed if its mismatch is
    as severe as the safety crossing's, so the two are calibrated on the model's own mean log-probability of the prefix given
    the request, and where they do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty instead of having a constant subtracted.
- term: Prefix family
  definition: >-
    One of two structurally different templates from which every hazardous continuation is generated. ANNOUNCED opens by naming
    what it is about to do; ENACTED performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement. Both are run because
    a result present only under an explicit announcement is a property of the announcement rather than of the content.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A training-free edit that removes a model's ability to refuse. One refusal direction is estimated by difference of means
    over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the last prompt token, then orthogonalised out of every weight matrix that writes
    to the residual stream. Everything it is fitted on lives on the request axis, which is the structural basis of the headline
    prediction. Here it is used as a controlled manipulation for localising the signal, in the way a lesion localises a function.
- term: Matched request-axis damage
  definition: >-
    The condition under which two lineages are compared after editing: edit strengths chosen so that each lineage loses an
    equal amount of O, read off its own measured strength-to-damage curve by interpolation. Without it, a lineage on which
    the edit simply bites less would look protected.
- term: Safe completion
  definition: >-
    An alignment style in which a model answers a risky request at a safe level of detail instead of refusing. Qwen3-4B-SafeRL
    is an openly released model of this kind: in non-think mode its card reports safety rising 64.7 to 98.1 on WildGuard and
    47.5 to 86.5 on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge, while refusal falls 12.9 to 5.3; in think mode refusal barely moves, 6.5
    to 6.2.
- term: Safe-engagement rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of harmful requests a model answers without refusing and without emitting harmful content. A co-primary target
    alongside harmful-compliance rate because, unlike refusal rate, it penalises a blanket refuser, and no cheap internal
    safety metric has been validated against it.
- term: Parent-fixed versus refitted direction
  definition: >-
    Two readout conventions, each registered where it is correct. Parent-fixed, the parent's direction applied to the edited
    child, is the only convention under which 'the arming fell more than the monitor' is a statement within one basis, so
    it is primary for the edited arm, and the direction is carried over rather than refitted inside a fold. A per-checkpoint
    refit is what the DEPLOYED metric must use, since an arbitrary HuggingFace model has no parent.
- term: Teacher forcing
  definition: >-
    Running the model over a fixed, pre-written continuation instead of letting it generate. It makes the four cells exactly
    comparable, costs one forward pass each, and removes sampling noise and decoding choices from the measurement.
- term: Benign twin
  definition: >-
    A request lexically and structurally close to a harmful one but carrying no harmful intent, drawn from XSTest's purpose-built
    safe split rather than authored from scratch. Twins are what make the request factor a manipulation of intent rather than
    of vocabulary.
summary: >-
  A response-site safety effect measured only under harmful requests is an average over an unvaried modifier, not a property
  of the model: crossing the request factor with the model's own already-written output splits that effect into an unconditional
  output monitor and a request-gated ARMING term, and the three Qwen3-4B checkpoints differ mainly in which one they have.
  The resulting three-number profile is read from one model's activations with no generation and no judge, and the claim is
  that a prompt-fitted weight edit destroys the arming term and leaves the monitor, so the pre-edit arming measurement forecasts
  how much safety survives the edit.
alternates:
- title: The refusal a model brings before it reads
  hypothesis: >-
    A model's refusal drive decomposes into an input-independent PRIOR, readable from a contentless forward pass with literally
    zero prompts, plus an input-dependent EVIDENCE slope, how far the internals move per unit of actual harmfulness. Published
    safety scores are a fixed monotone mixture of the two, which is why a model that is safer while refusing less is ranked
    backwards, and the two numbers read separately from one checkpoint's internals reproduce the mixture and beat it. Concretely:
    the base model has neither, the refusal-tuned model has a high prior, the safe-completion model has a low prior and a
    high slope, and abliteration drives the prior down while leaving the slope intact.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the arming interaction is swallowed by the coherence calibration -- if the mismatch penalty in the safety crossing
    cannot be matched and A_net survives only as an upper bound -- because then the interesting structure is entirely in the
    request-to-signal mapping and the prior-slope split is the sharpest decomposition of it. It also wins on cost, since the
    prior needs zero prompts, the extreme end of what the request asks for. It would have to be positioned tightly against
    signal-detection and item-response-theory treatments of refusal, which make the same conflation argument behaviourally
    rather than at the activation level.
- title: Measure safety without any harmful text
  hypothesis: >-
    A checkpoint's safety level is predictable from its internals on entirely benign or contentless inputs, with no harmful
    content anywhere in the pipeline, because safety training leaves a systematic footprint on ordinary computation. The claim
    is specific rather than correlational: safety training reserves residual-stream capacity and shifts benign computation
    in a direction that abliteration partially reverses, so the size of that shift, measured against the model's own benign
    baseline, orders the arms and transfers across families.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the matched-quadruple construction proves fragile -- if the Stage-0 twin, prefix or placebo gates fail -- since
    it needs no harmful prompts, no twins and no matched prefixes at all. It also wins on deployability: an instrument that
    never touches harmful content can be run on any checkpoint by anyone, and every existing cheap instrument still needs
    a harmful or jailbreak set even when it skips generation. Its risk is the mirror image of the main hypothesis's, since
    a footprint on benign computation may be a footprint of fine-tuning in general, so it lives or dies on the same non-safety
    fine-tune control.
- title: How long the hazard state survives
  hypothesis: >-
    The safety-relevant difference between the checkpoints is the PERSISTENCE of the internal hazard state. Under a fixed
    teacher-forced continuation identical across models, the hazard readout decays with token position at a rate that is a
    stable per-checkpoint property, and its time constant in tokens -- hence unit-free, and immune to the cross-checkpoint
    scale problem that forces every level comparison into null-SD units -- orders the checkpoints and predicts how well safety
    survives long generations. Predicted short in the refusal-tuned model, which only ever needed the signal at token one,
    long in the safe-completion model, near zero in the base model, short in the abliterated model.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the response-conditioned signal is real as a correlation but dies under harm-subspace patching, leaving decay
    rather than feedback as the mechanism, and it wins outright if the depth curve the main design already collects shows
    A is a transient rather than a plateau. It is also the cheaper instrument, needing one prompt and one fixed continuation
    per model rather than a matched quadruple plus a calibrated coherence control, and a decay constant estimates stably at
    small sample sizes where an interaction does not.
- title: Safety is a profile over harm domains
  hypothesis: >-
    Safety is not one mechanism but a set of harm-domain-specific write pathways with independently set gains, so a checkpoint's
    safety is a PROFILE over domains rather than a scalar, and the per-domain gains are readable from one model's internals
    with a handful of prompts per domain. The prediction that makes it testable on this trio: safety RL optimises an aggregate
    reward and should FLATTEN the profile, while abliteration removes a single direction fitted to one extraction set and
    should thin it unevenly, deepest in the domains that dominated that set, leaving a checkpoint genuinely still safe on
    some domains and not others.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if within-checkpoint variation across harm domains is larger than between-checkpoint variation, which would mean
    the field's single safety number is the wrong object however it is measured, and it would make the deliverable a risk
    profile rather than a score. It needs no counterfactual construction, no matched prefixes and no coherence control, so
    it is robust to the Stage-0 gates failing, and it is the only candidate whose output an open-weight release process could
    act on directly.

title: Which of the five safety readouts is still unclaimed
summary: >-
  Web-only saturation and anchor-verification pass, 2026-09-20, ~$0 spend, no cuts taken. All 26 core arXiv ids resolved (0
  unresolved, 0 mis-cited) plus 20 newly discovered ids. VERDICTS: K1 arming interaction = PARTIALLY SCOOPED (HARC 2607.00572
  owns the response-site readout via Eq 2 but never crosses the two factors, uses no matched twins, and reports no interaction);
  K2 prior + evidence slope = OPEN at the activation level but its construct is published behaviourally by IRT 2608.05086
  over 192 models; K3 benign-only footprint = PARTIALLY SCOOPED, with LatentBiopsy 2603.27412 - not Skin-Deep - as the true
  nearest relative; K4 persistence time constant = CLOSED by N-GLARE's JR Min/Max (ACL 2026 Long 1334, Eq 9), a per-model
  persistence scalar over 40+ models; K5 per-domain profile = PARTIALLY SCOOPED and thin. FOUR deliverable-level competitors,
  not two: N-GLARE, Skin-Deep/GFS, the 273-checkpoint abliteration audit 2607.01854, and IRT-10-items. F1 ANSWERED DECISIVELY:
  HARC does print numeric cross-position cosines, for Qwen, at 0.19/0.10 (L12) and 0.31/0.30 (L27), so lane B's |cos| <= 0.50
  gate is expected to PASS; 2604.18901's independent 73+/-7 degree protocol angle (cos ~ 0.29) converges on the same answer.
  F2 OVERTURNS THE PLANNING RECON: 2604.18901 prints +/-0.003 twice and 73 degrees twice, for four different quantities, and
  the hypothesis's readings were the right ones. Three new adverse priors the run had not seen: HRCI_repr (2606.16349) is
  a parent-free single-checkpoint coupling index whose authors report it is NOT a safety score; the Entanglement Wall gets
  AUROC 0.590-0.690 on XSTest-style twins; and harm recognition is invariant to abliteration in two independent papers. Ten
  baselines specified for reimplementation, including the newly recovered HRCI_repr formula. PROVENANCE: all 32 sources listed
  were ACTUALLY FETCHED (no snippet-only entries), and every one of the 59 supporting passages was re-verified by an independent
  live fetch of its own URL before this file was written.

title: Frozen safety stimulus set and source corpora
summary: |-
  FROZEN STIMULUS SUBSTRATE + SOURCE CORPORA for the Qwen3-4B safety mech-interp study. Nothing here touches a model: no weights (only the ~15 MB Qwen3 tokenizer), no forward pass, no activations, no direction fitted, no grading. Every number in the criteria table comes from downstream lanes reading these frozen files.

  WHAT full_data_out.json IS: the 10 kept source corpora, exp_sel_data_out schema, ONE SOURCE ROW PER EXAMPLE grouped by dataset (7604 examples): xstest_v2, or_bench_toxic, or_bench_hard_1k, strongreject_small, advbench_harmful_behaviors, jbb_behaviors_harmful, jbb_behaviors_benign, phtest, harmbench, databricks_dolly_15k. Built by data.py (stdlib only; `uv run --no-project data.py`). 15 candidates were standardised and inspected, 5 discarded with written reasons (redundancy, schema fit, unverified licence, CC-BY-NC); all 15 remain at results/full_data_out_all15.json. metadata_harm_domain uses the OR-Bench 10-value vocabulary; XSTest rows read theirs from results/twin_pairs.json so the corpora and the substrate carry ONE label per row.

  THE ACTUAL SUBSTRATE (data_out.json, 3,014 rows + heldout_cells.json, 1,350 SEALED rows): 150 genuine XSTest v2 minimal-edit twin pairs (focus-join and +25 offset agree on 149/150), hash-split 96 confirmatory / 54 sealed BEFORE any cell text existed (salt and both id-list SHA-256s in prereg.json). 3,877 rendered cells, every one exactly 144 tokens with its action slot intersecting BOTH read windows (EARLY 5-20, LATE 40-55) under the real Qwen/Qwen3-4B tokenizer; within an item+family the hazardous, benign and placebo continuations have IDENTICAL token counts at EVERY index and differ only inside the two slot regions. Tables: safety_2x2, placebo, coherence_control (also crossed with prefix family, a deliberate superset of the planned 600), graded_harm_ladder, contentless, fixed_shared_continuation, fitting_corpus (64 pairs, 0 shared action lemmas/4-grams with XSTest), harm_domain_profile, three behavioural request sets. Siblings: prereg.json (sha256 0b86d66a8dffca717f8c523569ab04a0987134158e36c342e738ab93b8027f50), model_registry.json (40 repos, metadata only, 36 ungated, 12 families with an ungated instruct arm, 2 SEALED: Qwen2.5-1.5B, SmolLM2-1.7B), judge_validation.json, rubric.md, templates.json, sources_manifest.json, verification_report.json.

  WHAT FAILED, AND IS REPORTED AS FAILED (do not read these as passes):
  1. Prefix HAZARD identification gate FAILED at 0.9429 vs a 0.95 threshold after the one regeneration round the plan allows. The threshold was NOT relaxed: the 16 affected items are marked metadata_qc_fail=true and metadata_confirmatory=false, and CONFIRMATORY n DROPS FROM 96 TO 85. 11 of the 16 are benign/placebo prefixes a rater called hazardous, concentrated in historical_events and safe_contexts, whose benign member is an explanatory act ABOUT a harmful topic.
  2. Placebo distance gate FAILED: median edit distance ratio 1.25 vs the required <=1.10. A floor, not a search failure: a placebo SELECTED from another item's benign action cannot beat the ~5-token distance between two unrelated short phrases, and enlarging the pool 100->164 does not move the median. Mean ratio is 1.133 and 99/150 items match exactly; per-item distances ship as metadata_levenshtein_to_benign_prefix so a lane regresses on them instead of subtracting a constant.
  3. XSTest CANNOT supply 6 harm domains: it is violence-skewed and only 3 of 10 reach 8 confirmatory twin pairs. Thin domains are topped up from OR-Bench with twin_available=false, so K5's per-domain profile rests PARTLY ON NON-TWIN items. The 2x2 and the ladder use twins ONLY; no non-twin row ever enters the 2x2.
  4. Only 4 of the 6 contrast families are SURFACE-minimal. definitions and historical_events are matched on topic via the shared focus term but rewrite the sentence frame; metadata_minimal_edit_tier ships so a lane needing a small surface edit can restrict to Tier A (100 pairs, 64 confirmatory).
  5. The ladder covers 149 of 150 items; one pair was declined by both model families and its rungs 1-3 are null.
  6. There is NO human rater anywhere in this pipeline; two cross-family LLM raters substitute. A substitution, not an equivalence.

  GATES THAT PASSED: twin-member identification 0.9967, announce-vs-enact 0.9506, ladder Spearman rho 0.878, non-operationality 0 flags over 360 distinct hazardous continuations, pooled Cohen's kappa 0.8953. 32/33 verification checks pass. OpenRouter spend $2.52 of the $10 cap. walledai/HarmBench and allenai/wildguardmix are genuinely gated and were skipped, never authenticated or substituted; or-bench-80k was never ingested.

  DOWNSTREAM CONTRACT: read data_out.json for the confirmatory work and NEVER open heldout_cells.json in a lane that fits, tunes or selects. Quote prereg.sha256 to show nothing was chosen after the fact. Filter on metadata_qc_fail and metadata_confirmatory, not on metadata_fold alone, or you will silently re-include the 16 excluded items.

title: Where safety lives in a model's activations
summary: |-
  LANE A EXECUTED IN FULL. Seven Qwen3-4B checkpoints (instruct, SafeRL, Base under both a chat-template and a plain protocol, a non-safety task fine-tune of the same base, mlabonne's abliterated edit, and an architecture-identical RANDOMLY INITIALISED control added per the mech-interp handbook) were each streamed through ONE teacher-forced activation harvest: 1,913 passes per checkpoint, 13,391 total, ZERO generated tokens, 85-274 s each. Nothing was skipped, no CPU-offload fallback fired.

  DESIGN. A 2x2 crossing of REQUEST (XSTest minimal-edit twins) x CONTINUATION (a pre-written procedural frame in which only the named ACTION varies). Prefixes are built as TOKEN ID LISTS with the ACTION pinned to token 8 and token 46 of an exactly-80-token prefix, so the hazardous and benign cells read at IDENTICAL offsets and no read window can be structurally empty. Terms: O (orientation), CB (content-bearing), A (arming interaction), T = CB + A -- the identity holds to 0.0 per item, a decisive wiring check. Projections onto r_content, a diff-in-means axis fitted on a DISJOINT 128-pair corpus (zero exact/5-gram overlap with the twins). 54 of 150 twin pairs were hash-split out before any activation was collected and never loaded. Pre-registration frozen by SHA-256 before the first forward pass and re-verified by the analysis.

  HEADLINE RESULTS. (1) THE ARMING TERM IS REFUTED BY ITS OWN CONTROL. A reaches -4.3..-9.3 null-SD, but refitting r_content on PERMUTED labels and re-running the whole pipeline reproduces |A| up to 11.0-11.8; A escapes that shuffled-label band in NO checkpoint. In the random-init arm the band collapses to 1.27 and the real term collapses with it, proving the width is a property of trained representations. T escapes in only 3 of 7 -- all three NON-safety arms. The two nulls (isotropic random-direction SD as the UNIT vs shuffled-label band as the EVIDENCE test) disagree, and only the second licenses a claim.
  (2) S1: ONLY K3 PASSES (benign-only activation footprint; margins +1.07 and +0.74 null-SD over both non-safety arms, CIs excluding zero). K1, K2, K4, K5 FAIL. K3 needs NO harmful prompt, and its weights-only twin (mean stable rank over the band) needs NO prompt at all: 216.3 in every trained checkpoint vs 977.4 random-init.
  (3) |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.04-0.09 at the band, max 0.19 over any layer. The response-site continuation-harm axis and the prompt-site request-refusal axis are NEAR-ORTHOGONAL, so HARC (arXiv:2607.00572) "remain aligned" does not hold at 4B -- and a parent-fixed post-edit arm is therefore NOT confounded.
  (4) CROSS-LINEAGE DISSOCIATION (licensed because the panel is one fine-tuning lineage; the random-init arm returns 0.01-0.02 as the unrelated-basis null): cos(r_content) is 0.90-0.99 for every trained pair, while cos(r_ablit) is 0.896 for Qwen3-4B->SafeRL, 0.361 for Qwen3-4B->abliterated, 0.200 for Base->instruct and 0.041 for Base-chat vs abliterated. Safety training moves the REFUSAL axis and leaves the CONTENT axis alone; abliteration rotates refusal away from its own parent.

  GATES AND BASELINES. Band frozen at layers 14-22 (depth 0.39-0.61) by cross-fitted d on Qwen3-4B's fitting corpus alone. G3 positive control passes in all six trained arms (cross-fitted d 0.85-0.95) and fails in random-init (0.58). G1 FAILS EVERYWHERE (split-half cosine 0.35-0.39 vs 0.70), so the registered fallback fired and a supervised probe axis is reported beside every K1 term. Baselines: B1 diff-in-means AUROC 0.66-0.73, B2 raw-hidden-vector probe 0.97-0.98 (the supervised ceiling), B3 cluster separation, B4 refusal logit gap at TWO read sites (the first-response-token site is structurally zero for a continuation contrast, so a post-continuation site was added to keep the baseline fair) -- B4 is labelled NOT-A-DELIVERABLE under the run invariant. G5 placebo TOST fails everywhere; G6 licenses subtraction only in the non-safety arms, so A_net is an upper bound in the safety arms; K4's tau is UNDEFINED everywhere (R^2<0.3). Achieved r is 3.2-10.0 against a planned 1.2, so the MDE at n=96 is 0.65-1.99 -- above the registered 0.50 and stated as an under-powering, not relaxed. External judge gate PASSED (twin forced-choice 0.979, prefix hazard rating 0.900) for $0.0023 of a $10 budget.

  ARTEFACTS. out/method_out.json (schema-validated) carries every gate, the null-SD and scale tables, per-item quantiles, the S1 table, the cosine curves and all baselines; out/SUMMARY.md is the human digest; out/released/ has 24,192 per-item cell projections, r_content/r_ablit .npy, layer-by-position maps, position curves, the cross-checkpoint direction table and the item substrate. Lane A declares NO survivor: S1 is 1 of 3 screen tests and promotion needs >=2 of 3 from lanes B and C. HARVEST FORMAT: archives over 100 MB (grid/proj/fit) are stored as axis-0 row shards -- <name>.partNNN.npz plus <name>.shards.json -- and are read with lane_a.shard.load_npz, which reassembles them byte-identically.

title: Uncensoring a model doesn't blind it to harm
summary: |-
  LANE B asks where safety lives by LESIONING it: one rank-one, prompt-fitted orthogonalisation W <- W - a*u*(u^T W) applied to every residual-stream write matrix (o_proj + down_proj, all 36 layers) at five strengths, with all five candidate readouts (K1 arming, K2 prior+slope, K3 benign-only footprint, K4 persistence, K5 domain profile) recomputed before and after. Substrate: 150 XSTest minimal-edit twins from the six genuine contrast families, sha256-ordered 96/54 split (the 54 never touched), a 2x2 of request{harmful, matched benign twin} x response-prefix{hazardous, benign} with the response span token-identical across the request manipulation, plus disjoint fitting and held-out request corpora. prereg.json was frozen before the first forward pass and verified byte-identical at the end.

  INSTRUMENT. Qwen3 gives o_proj/down_proj no bias, so for y = W0 x the edit is EXACTLY y -> y - a*u*(u^T y). Applied as an output projection, alpha=0 is a BITWISE no-op, the restore is exact, and embed_tokens - which IS lm_head on all four lineages, L4 included - is provably untouched, so the causal arm's logit outcome is uncontaminated. Verified against a genuine bf16 weight mutation. Frozen band = layers 13-21, r_content split-half cosine 0.927.

  MAIN RESULT. The lesion is verified exact - the raw projection gap along u falls as [1.0, 0.744, 0.482, 0.228, 0.0] against a predicted (1-alpha) - and the harm representation survives it ENTIRELY: the held-out 5-fold CV probe reads [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] across the alpha grid. Removing u POST-HOC from activations instead drops that probe 1.000 -> NA, while removing 128 RANDOM directions costs nothing. So in the INTACT model the 2559-dim orthogonal complement of u is NOT sufficient. In the LESIONED model, which was never allowed to write u at all, that same complement reads 1.000 and behaves identically under its own top-direction removal (NA). (The post-lesion orthogonality itself is FORCED by construction and is not claimed as a result.) The obvious alternative - that removing a class-correlated component changes the residual NORM class-correlatedly and RMSNorm manufactures the separability - is REJECTED: the probe still reads NA on unit-normalised activations, and the norm alone flips from a NA-AUROC harm detector in the intact model to NA (anti-predictive) after the lesion. Depth profile: held-out AUROC is already ~1.000 by layer 13 in BOTH states, while the signal along u grows ~138x with depth in the intact model (NA -> NA) and is zeroed at every depth in the lesioned one. u is an ACCUMULATOR COORDINATE, not the locus of the percept: abliteration removes the refusal ACTION, not the harm PERCEPT.

  G1, reported as a RESULT and not only a gate: |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.159 pooled / 0.175 max. The response-site content axis and the prompt-site request axis are near-ORTHOGONAL, so HARC's alignment kill-risk does not bite here.

  STAGE 9, weights only: mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated is per-matrix rank-one (median 0.9945) at implied alpha 0.973, leaves embed_tokens untouched, but uses ONE DIRECTION PER LAYER: pooled rank-one share only 0.433, and |cos| 0.016 between the shallowest and deepest layer's edit direction.

  THE METRIC (the run prompt's 'few-prompt safety score'). Fit r_ablit at EVERY layer of ONE model from 128 harmful + 128 harmless PROMPT-ONLY forwards - no generation, no benchmark, no judge, no reference model - and report the best layer's Cohen's d and its DEPTH FRACTION: L2 Qwen3-4B d=11.15 at layer 22 (depth 0.64). Safety tuning roughly DOUBLES the separation and moves it several layers EARLIER. The load-bearing control is L4, a fine-tune of L1 on a NON-safety objective: it lands on top of its base parent, so the readout tracks SAFETY tuning, not fine-tuning as such. n = 4 checkpoints, so this is a demonstration with one clean negative control, not a validated metric; the outputs carry a prompt-budget curve for how few items the paired contrasts need.

  HONEST LIMITS. The pre-registered PRIMARY damage variable is FLAT at ceiling, so no matched-damage point exists for 1 lineage(s) and every registered S2 row is INDETERMINATE (failure mode F1). The threshold was NOT relaxed and alpha=1 was not extrapolated past; a LABELLED full-annihilation companion is reported beside it. Read as the LEVEL test its wording specifies, K1 is HALF-satisfied: CB survives but A attenuates without collapsing into the null band. K4's observed sign is OPPOSITE to its registered signature (tau lengthens). Registered grid: ['L2']; declared per-layer grid: []. method_out.json carries 673 examples over 7 datasets; every predict_* that is not predict_baseline_* reads activations or weights of a SINGLE model.

title: Predicting model safety from its activations
summary: >-
  LANE C (test S3): does an activation/weight-only, single-model safety readout predict real safety BEHAVIOUR across model
  families, and from how few prompts? Panel: 21 scored checkpoints across 7 ungated <=4B families (Qwen3 incl. the commissioned
  4B Base/Instruct/SafeRL trio plus 0.6B/1.7B arms; Qwen2.5; SmolLM3; Granite; OLMo-2; TinyLlama; Phi-4-mini) plus 2 SEALED
  families (StableLM, SmolLM2) fully measured but withheld from truth for iteration 2. Everything is frozen by SHA-256 in
  prereg.json before the first activation. From ONE teacher-forced harvest per checkpoint we compute five single-model candidate
  readouts -- K1 arming decomposition [O, CB, A, T] of the projection onto a response-site content direction r_content (fit
  per-checkpoint on a disjoint corpus, split-half cosine ~0.95, held-out AUROC ~1.0, |cos(r_content,r_request)| ~0.35-0.60
  so the content axis is distinct from the abliteration/request axis); K2 request-side prior+slope; K3 base-relative footprint
  (activation + weight, undefined for 2-arm families); K4 hazard-decay tau; K5 domain profile -- all placed in a random-direction
  NULL-SD unit so features are comparable across hidden sizes 1024..3072 with NO recalibration. Seven baselines: B1 card/name
  regex, B2 refusal rate, B3 first-token refusal-logit gap, B4 prompt-axis Fisher, B5 r_request projection, B6 raw-hidden
  geometry, B7 an N-GLARE (arXiv:2511.14195) APT/JSS reimplementation (labelled, not the authors' code). Behavioural ground
  truth (harmful-compliance, over-refusal, and the co-primary SAFE-ENGAGEMENT) comes from greedy generations LLM-judged by
  gemini-2.5-flash-lite, audited by gpt-5-mini (kappa refused 0.71, harmful_content 0.57, on_topic_help 0.47; raw agreement
  0.86/0.84/0.74). S3 = leave-one-family-out ridge prediction with z-scoring/PCA/ridge all fit on training families only;
  metric = pairwise ranking accuracy (|delta truth|>=0.05), decision = margin>=0.15 over the oracle-selected strongest baseline
  AND family-clustered bootstrap 95% CI>0 AND >=5/7 families won. HEADLINE (both outcomes publishable): NO candidate passes
  S3 on either target; machinery controls are clean (oracle ranking accuracy 1.00; random 0.556/shuffle 0.585 mean noise floor).
  The strongest cross-family predictor is the LOGIT baseline B3 (first-token refusal-logit gap: 0.851 safe-engagement, 0.863
  harmful-compliance); the best ACTIVATION candidate is K1 arming (0.671 safe-engagement; 0.810 harmful-compliance, already
  0.882 from just k=4 prompts) but it does not surpass B3. A sharp within-family mechanism is nonetheless visible: across
  the commissioned Qwen3-4B trio the arming term A orders Base(-2.32) < Instruct(+0.18) < SafeRL(+1.90), and SafeRL is a safe-completion
  model (~0% refusal) whose safety refusal-based baselines miss internally -- yet this arming signal does not transfer across
  families to beat B3 at this panel size. The result localises that the response-site arming representation is real and family-specific
  but not a family-invariant behavioural predictor; per the screen's rule iteration 2 widens rather than deepening. Deliverables:

title: Which of the five safety readouts is still unclaimed
summary: >-
  Web-only saturation and anchor-verification pass, 2026-09-20, ~$0 spend, no cuts taken. All 26 core arXiv ids resolved (0
  unresolved, 0 mis-cited) plus 20 newly discovered ids. VERDICTS: K1 arming interaction = PARTIALLY SCOOPED (HARC 2607.00572
  owns the response-site readout via Eq 2 but never crosses the two factors, uses no matched twins, and reports no interaction);
  K2 prior + evidence slope = OPEN at the activation level but its construct is published behaviourally by IRT 2608.05086
  over 192 models; K3 benign-only footprint = PARTIALLY SCOOPED, with LatentBiopsy 2603.27412 - not Skin-Deep - as the true
  nearest relative; K4 persistence time constant = CLOSED by N-GLARE's JR Min/Max (ACL 2026 Long 1334, Eq 9), a per-model
  persistence scalar over 40+ models; K5 per-domain profile = PARTIALLY SCOOPED and thin. FOUR deliverable-level competitors,
  not two: N-GLARE, Skin-Deep/GFS, the 273-checkpoint abliteration audit 2607.01854, and IRT-10-items. F1 ANSWERED DECISIVELY:
  HARC does print numeric cross-position cosines, for Qwen, at 0.19/0.10 (L12) and 0.31/0.30 (L27), so lane B's |cos| <= 0.50
  gate is expected to PASS; 2604.18901's independent 73+/-7 degree protocol angle (cos ~ 0.29) converges on the same answer.
  F2 OVERTURNS THE PLANNING RECON: 2604.18901 prints +/-0.003 twice and 73 degrees twice, for four different quantities, and
  the hypothesis's readings were the right ones. Three new adverse priors the run had not seen: HRCI_repr (2606.16349) is
  a parent-free single-checkpoint coupling index whose authors report it is NOT a safety score; the Entanglement Wall gets
  AUROC 0.590-0.690 on XSTest-style twins; and harm recognition is invariant to abliteration in two independent papers. Ten
  baselines specified for reimplementation, including the newly recovered HRCI_repr formula. PROVENANCE: all 32 sources listed
  were ACTUALLY FETCHED (no snippet-only entries), and every one of the 59 supporting passages was re-verified by an independent
  live fetch of its own URL before this file was written.

title: Frozen safety stimulus set and source corpora
summary: |-
  FROZEN STIMULUS SUBSTRATE + SOURCE CORPORA for the Qwen3-4B safety mech-interp study. Nothing here touches a model: no weights (only the ~15 MB Qwen3 tokenizer), no forward pass, no activations, no direction fitted, no grading. Every number in the criteria table comes from downstream lanes reading these frozen files.

  WHAT full_data_out.json IS: the 10 kept source corpora, exp_sel_data_out schema, ONE SOURCE ROW PER EXAMPLE grouped by dataset (7604 examples): xstest_v2, or_bench_toxic, or_bench_hard_1k, strongreject_small, advbench_harmful_behaviors, jbb_behaviors_harmful, jbb_behaviors_benign, phtest, harmbench, databricks_dolly_15k. Built by data.py (stdlib only; `uv run --no-project data.py`). 15 candidates were standardised and inspected, 5 discarded with written reasons (redundancy, schema fit, unverified licence, CC-BY-NC); all 15 remain at results/full_data_out_all15.json. metadata_harm_domain uses the OR-Bench 10-value vocabulary; XSTest rows read theirs from results/twin_pairs.json so the corpora and the substrate carry ONE label per row.

  THE ACTUAL SUBSTRATE (data_out.json, 3,014 rows + heldout_cells.json, 1,350 SEALED rows): 150 genuine XSTest v2 minimal-edit twin pairs (focus-join and +25 offset agree on 149/150), hash-split 96 confirmatory / 54 sealed BEFORE any cell text existed (salt and both id-list SHA-256s in prereg.json). 3,877 rendered cells, every one exactly 144 tokens with its action slot intersecting BOTH read windows (EARLY 5-20, LATE 40-55) under the real Qwen/Qwen3-4B tokenizer; within an item+family the hazardous, benign and placebo continuations have IDENTICAL token counts at EVERY index and differ only inside the two slot regions. Tables: safety_2x2, placebo, coherence_control (also crossed with prefix family, a deliberate superset of the planned 600), graded_harm_ladder, contentless, fixed_shared_continuation, fitting_corpus (64 pairs, 0 shared action lemmas/4-grams with XSTest), harm_domain_profile, three behavioural request sets. Siblings: prereg.json (sha256 0b86d66a8dffca717f8c523569ab04a0987134158e36c342e738ab93b8027f50), model_registry.json (40 repos, metadata only, 36 ungated, 12 families with an ungated instruct arm, 2 SEALED: Qwen2.5-1.5B, SmolLM2-1.7B), judge_validation.json, rubric.md, templates.json, sources_manifest.json, verification_report.json.

  WHAT FAILED, AND IS REPORTED AS FAILED (do not read these as passes):
  1. Prefix HAZARD identification gate FAILED at 0.9429 vs a 0.95 threshold after the one regeneration round the plan allows. The threshold was NOT relaxed: the 16 affected items are marked metadata_qc_fail=true and metadata_confirmatory=false, and CONFIRMATORY n DROPS FROM 96 TO 85. 11 of the 16 are benign/placebo prefixes a rater called hazardous, concentrated in historical_events and safe_contexts, whose benign member is an explanatory act ABOUT a harmful topic.
  2. Placebo distance gate FAILED: median edit distance ratio 1.25 vs the required <=1.10. A floor, not a search failure: a placebo SELECTED from another item's benign action cannot beat the ~5-token distance between two unrelated short phrases, and enlarging the pool 100->164 does not move the median. Mean ratio is 1.133 and 99/150 items match exactly; per-item distances ship as metadata_levenshtein_to_benign_prefix so a lane regresses on them instead of subtracting a constant.
  3. XSTest CANNOT supply 6 harm domains: it is violence-skewed and only 3 of 10 reach 8 confirmatory twin pairs. Thin domains are topped up from OR-Bench with twin_available=false, so K5's per-domain profile rests PARTLY ON NON-TWIN items. The 2x2 and the ladder use twins ONLY; no non-twin row ever enters the 2x2.
  4. Only 4 of the 6 contrast families are SURFACE-minimal. definitions and historical_events are matched on topic via the shared focus term but rewrite the sentence frame; metadata_minimal_edit_tier ships so a lane needing a small surface edit can restrict to Tier A (100 pairs, 64 confirmatory).
  5. The ladder covers 149 of 150 items; one pair was declined by both model families and its rungs 1-3 are null.
  6. There is NO human rater anywhere in this pipeline; two cross-family LLM raters substitute. A substitution, not an equivalence.

  GATES THAT PASSED: twin-member identification 0.9967, announce-vs-enact 0.9506, ladder Spearman rho 0.878, non-operationality 0 flags over 360 distinct hazardous continuations, pooled Cohen's kappa 0.8953. 32/33 verification checks pass. OpenRouter spend $2.52 of the $10 cap. walledai/HarmBench and allenai/wildguardmix are genuinely gated and were skipped, never authenticated or substituted; or-bench-80k was never ingested.

  DOWNSTREAM CONTRACT: read data_out.json for the confirmatory work and NEVER open heldout_cells.json in a lane that fits, tunes or selects. Quote prereg.sha256 to show nothing was chosen after the fact. Filter on metadata_qc_fail and metadata_confirmatory, not on metadata_fold alone, or you will silently re-include the 16 excluded items.

title: Where safety lives in a model's activations
summary: |-
  LANE A EXECUTED IN FULL. Seven Qwen3-4B checkpoints (instruct, SafeRL, Base under both a chat-template and a plain protocol, a non-safety task fine-tune of the same base, mlabonne's abliterated edit, and an architecture-identical RANDOMLY INITIALISED control added per the mech-interp handbook) were each streamed through ONE teacher-forced activation harvest: 1,913 passes per checkpoint, 13,391 total, ZERO generated tokens, 85-274 s each. Nothing was skipped, no CPU-offload fallback fired.

  DESIGN. A 2x2 crossing of REQUEST (XSTest minimal-edit twins) x CONTINUATION (a pre-written procedural frame in which only the named ACTION varies). Prefixes are built as TOKEN ID LISTS with the ACTION pinned to token 8 and token 46 of an exactly-80-token prefix, so the hazardous and benign cells read at IDENTICAL offsets and no read window can be structurally empty. Terms: O (orientation), CB (content-bearing), A (arming interaction), T = CB + A -- the identity holds to 0.0 per item, a decisive wiring check. Projections onto r_content, a diff-in-means axis fitted on a DISJOINT 128-pair corpus (zero exact/5-gram overlap with the twins). 54 of 150 twin pairs were hash-split out before any activation was collected and never loaded. Pre-registration frozen by SHA-256 before the first forward pass and re-verified by the analysis.

  HEADLINE RESULTS. (1) THE ARMING TERM IS REFUTED BY ITS OWN CONTROL. A reaches -4.3..-9.3 null-SD, but refitting r_content on PERMUTED labels and re-running the whole pipeline reproduces |A| up to 11.0-11.8; A escapes that shuffled-label band in NO checkpoint. In the random-init arm the band collapses to 1.27 and the real term collapses with it, proving the width is a property of trained representations. T escapes in only 3 of 7 -- all three NON-safety arms. The two nulls (isotropic random-direction SD as the UNIT vs shuffled-label band as the EVIDENCE test) disagree, and only the second licenses a claim.
  (2) S1: ONLY K3 PASSES (benign-only activation footprint; margins +1.07 and +0.74 null-SD over both non-safety arms, CIs excluding zero). K1, K2, K4, K5 FAIL. K3 needs NO harmful prompt, and its weights-only twin (mean stable rank over the band) needs NO prompt at all: 216.3 in every trained checkpoint vs 977.4 random-init.
  (3) |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.04-0.09 at the band, max 0.19 over any layer. The response-site continuation-harm axis and the prompt-site request-refusal axis are NEAR-ORTHOGONAL, so HARC (arXiv:2607.00572) "remain aligned" does not hold at 4B -- and a parent-fixed post-edit arm is therefore NOT confounded.
  (4) CROSS-LINEAGE DISSOCIATION (licensed because the panel is one fine-tuning lineage; the random-init arm returns 0.01-0.02 as the unrelated-basis null): cos(r_content) is 0.90-0.99 for every trained pair, while cos(r_ablit) is 0.896 for Qwen3-4B->SafeRL, 0.361 for Qwen3-4B->abliterated, 0.200 for Base->instruct and 0.041 for Base-chat vs abliterated. Safety training moves the REFUSAL axis and leaves the CONTENT axis alone; abliteration rotates refusal away from its own parent.

  GATES AND BASELINES. Band frozen at layers 14-22 (depth 0.39-0.61) by cross-fitted d on Qwen3-4B's fitting corpus alone. G3 positive control passes in all six trained arms (cross-fitted d 0.85-0.95) and fails in random-init (0.58). G1 FAILS EVERYWHERE (split-half cosine 0.35-0.39 vs 0.70), so the registered fallback fired and a supervised probe axis is reported beside every K1 term. Baselines: B1 diff-in-means AUROC 0.66-0.73, B2 raw-hidden-vector probe 0.97-0.98 (the supervised ceiling), B3 cluster separation, B4 refusal logit gap at TWO read sites (the first-response-token site is structurally zero for a continuation contrast, so a post-continuation site was added to keep the baseline fair) -- B4 is labelled NOT-A-DELIVERABLE under the run invariant. G5 placebo TOST fails everywhere; G6 licenses subtraction only in the non-safety arms, so A_net is an upper bound in the safety arms; K4's tau is UNDEFINED everywhere (R^2<0.3). Achieved r is 3.2-10.0 against a planned 1.2, so the MDE at n=96 is 0.65-1.99 -- above the registered 0.50 and stated as an under-powering, not relaxed. External judge gate PASSED (twin forced-choice 0.979, prefix hazard rating 0.900) for $0.0023 of a $10 budget.

  ARTEFACTS. out/method_out.json (schema-validated) carries every gate, the null-SD and scale tables, per-item quantiles, the S1 table, the cosine curves and all baselines; out/SUMMARY.md is the human digest; out/released/ has 24,192 per-item cell projections, r_content/r_ablit .npy, layer-by-position maps, position curves, the cross-checkpoint direction table and the item substrate. Lane A declares NO survivor: S1 is 1 of 3 screen tests and promotion needs >=2 of 3 from lanes B and C. HARVEST FORMAT: archives over 100 MB (grid/proj/fit) are stored as axis-0 row shards -- <name>.partNNN.npz plus <name>.shards.json -- and are read with lane_a.shard.load_npz, which reassembles them byte-identically.

title: Uncensoring a model doesn't blind it to harm
summary: |-
  LANE B asks where safety lives by LESIONING it: one rank-one, prompt-fitted orthogonalisation W <- W - a*u*(u^T W) applied to every residual-stream write matrix (o_proj + down_proj, all 36 layers) at five strengths, with all five candidate readouts (K1 arming, K2 prior+slope, K3 benign-only footprint, K4 persistence, K5 domain profile) recomputed before and after. Substrate: 150 XSTest minimal-edit twins from the six genuine contrast families, sha256-ordered 96/54 split (the 54 never touched), a 2x2 of request{harmful, matched benign twin} x response-prefix{hazardous, benign} with the response span token-identical across the request manipulation, plus disjoint fitting and held-out request corpora. prereg.json was frozen before the first forward pass and verified byte-identical at the end.

  INSTRUMENT. Qwen3 gives o_proj/down_proj no bias, so for y = W0 x the edit is EXACTLY y -> y - a*u*(u^T y). Applied as an output projection, alpha=0 is a BITWISE no-op, the restore is exact, and embed_tokens - which IS lm_head on all four lineages, L4 included - is provably untouched, so the causal arm's logit outcome is uncontaminated. Verified against a genuine bf16 weight mutation. Frozen band = layers 13-21, r_content split-half cosine 0.927.

  MAIN RESULT. The lesion is verified exact - the raw projection gap along u falls as [1.0, 0.744, 0.482, 0.228, 0.0] against a predicted (1-alpha) - and the harm representation survives it ENTIRELY: the held-out 5-fold CV probe reads [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] across the alpha grid. Removing u POST-HOC from activations instead drops that probe 1.000 -> NA, while removing 128 RANDOM directions costs nothing. So in the INTACT model the 2559-dim orthogonal complement of u is NOT sufficient. In the LESIONED model, which was never allowed to write u at all, that same complement reads 1.000 and behaves identically under its own top-direction removal (NA). (The post-lesion orthogonality itself is FORCED by construction and is not claimed as a result.) The obvious alternative - that removing a class-correlated component changes the residual NORM class-correlatedly and RMSNorm manufactures the separability - is REJECTED: the probe still reads NA on unit-normalised activations, and the norm alone flips from a NA-AUROC harm detector in the intact model to NA (anti-predictive) after the lesion. Depth profile: held-out AUROC is already ~1.000 by layer 13 in BOTH states, while the signal along u grows ~138x with depth in the intact model (NA -> NA) and is zeroed at every depth in the lesioned one. u is an ACCUMULATOR COORDINATE, not the locus of the percept: abliteration removes the refusal ACTION, not the harm PERCEPT.

  G1, reported as a RESULT and not only a gate: |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.159 pooled / 0.175 max. The response-site content axis and the prompt-site request axis are near-ORTHOGONAL, so HARC's alignment kill-risk does not bite here.

  STAGE 9, weights only: mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated is per-matrix rank-one (median 0.9945) at implied alpha 0.973, leaves embed_tokens untouched, but uses ONE DIRECTION PER LAYER: pooled rank-one share only 0.433, and |cos| 0.016 between the shallowest and deepest layer's edit direction.

  THE METRIC (the run prompt's 'few-prompt safety score'). Fit r_ablit at EVERY layer of ONE model from 128 harmful + 128 harmless PROMPT-ONLY forwards - no generation, no benchmark, no judge, no reference model - and report the best layer's Cohen's d and its DEPTH FRACTION: L2 Qwen3-4B d=11.15 at layer 22 (depth 0.64). Safety tuning roughly DOUBLES the separation and moves it several layers EARLIER. The load-bearing control is L4, a fine-tune of L1 on a NON-safety objective: it lands on top of its base parent, so the readout tracks SAFETY tuning, not fine-tuning as such. n = 4 checkpoints, so this is a demonstration with one clean negative control, not a validated metric; the outputs carry a prompt-budget curve for how few items the paired contrasts need.

  HONEST LIMITS. The pre-registered PRIMARY damage variable is FLAT at ceiling, so no matched-damage point exists for 1 lineage(s) and every registered S2 row is INDETERMINATE (failure mode F1). The threshold was NOT relaxed and alpha=1 was not extrapolated past; a LABELLED full-annihilation companion is reported beside it. Read as the LEVEL test its wording specifies, K1 is HALF-satisfied: CB survives but A attenuates without collapsing into the null band. K4's observed sign is OPPOSITE to its registered signature (tau lengthens). Registered grid: ['L2']; declared per-layer grid: []. method_out.json carries 673 examples over 7 datasets; every predict_* that is not predict_baseline_* reads activations or weights of a SINGLE model.

  The strongest cross-family predictor is the LOGIT baseline B3 (first-token refusal-logit gap: 0.851 safe-engagement, 0.863

  0.882 from just k=4 prompts) but it does not surpass B3. A sharp within-family mechanism is nonetheless visible: across
  the commissioned Qwen3-4B trio the arming term A orders Base(-2.32) < Instruct(+0.18) < SafeRL(+1.90), and SafeRL is a safe-completion
  model (~0% refusal) whose safety refusal-based baselines miss internally -- yet this arming signal does not transfer across
  families to beat B3 at this panel size. The result localises that the response-site arming representation is real and family-specific

## 1 Introduction

Language models aligned through safety tuning can refuse harmful requests, but the internal mechanisms behind this refusal remain contested. A growing body of work argues that refusal is mediated by a single direction in activation space [1], that it can be removed by a rank-one weight edit called abliteration [1, 2], and that the resulting model generates harmful content freely. This has led to a practical arms race: defenders build abliteration-resistant training [3], while the community publishes abliterated checkpoints on model hubs.

The standard account treats the direction that abliteration removes as the safety mechanism itself. If removing a direction removes refusal, the reasoning goes, the direction must encode the model's understanding of harm. But this inference conflates two things: the model's willingness to refuse (an action) and its ability to recognise harmful content (a percept). A model could represent harm along one direction and route its refusal decision through another, in which case deleting the refusal direction would change behaviour without changing understanding.

Recent work supports this possibility from several angles. Linear probes on internal representations discriminate hazardous content at 98.2% AUROC in a model that itself flags only 45% of those hazards, a 53-point gap between readability and actionability [4]. Internal harmfulness scores read at prompt-dependent locations anti-rank successful jailbreaks at AUROC 0.220, meaning successful attacks rank lower than failed ones [5]. Response-time probes achieve AUROC 0

.97 to 1.00 at generated positions [6], far above what prompt-time defences provide. These findings suggest that language models encode harm information more richly than their refusal behaviour reveals, but no published study has directly tested whether abliteration removes the representation or only the action.

We address this question through a controlled lesion study on the Qwen3-4B family, chosen because it provides base, instruction-tuned (Qwen3-4B), safety-RL (Qwen3-4B-SafeRL), and community-abliterated (mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated) checkpoints sharing one architecture, one tokenizer, and a declared fine-tuning lineage. Our design separates two internal axes: a response-content axis r_content fitted on hazardous versus benign continuations at response positions, and the request axis r_ablit fitted on harmful versus harmless requests at the last prompt token, the direction abliteration targets. The key instrument check is their cosine similarity: if it is high, deleting one necessarily affects the other. If it is low, the lesion's effect on the representation is an empirical question rather than an algebraic certainty.

Our contributions are:

1. The response-content and request axes are near-orthogonal (|cos| = 0.04 to 0.09 at the frozen band, max 0.19 over any layer), establishing that abliteration operates in a direction nearly perpendicular to the model's response-content harm representation [ARTIFACT:art_2QM9uBviY4Wk].

2. A rank-one lesion that completely removes the request axis leaves the harm representation intact: held-out cross-validated probe AUROC remains 1.000 across all five edit strengths, while the one-dimensional readout along the deleted axis collapses from 0.999 to 0.590. The request axis is an accumulator, not the locus of the percept [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

3. Safety training doubles the request-axis separation (Cohen's d 5.7 to 11.2) and shifts it earlier in depth (layer 29 to layer 22), a signature that a non-safety fine-tune of the same base does not produce (d = 5.74, layer 29) [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

4. Across a 21-checkpoint, 7-family panel with LLM-judged behavioural ground truth, no activation-based readout surpasses the first-token refusal-logit gap for cross-family safety prediction, though the arming decomposition achieves 0.882 ranking accuracy on harmful-compliance from just 4 prompts within the Qwen3 family [ARTIFACT:art_rpTmjn5qclSY].

5. We release 24,192 per-item cell projections, the fitted directions, and the full stimulus substrate for all seven checkpoints.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 describes the method, including the stimulus construction, the two-axis framework, and the lesion protocol. Section 4 details the experimental setup. Section 5 presents results from three experimental lanes. Section 6 discusses implications and limitations.

## 2 Related Work

**Refusal mechanisms and abliteration.** Arditi et al. [1] demonstrated that refusal in instruction-tuned models is mediated by a single direction in residual-stream space, and that orthogonalising this direction out of every weight matrix (abliteration) removes refusal. Subsequent work revealed that this picture is incomplete: Marshall and Belrose [2] showed the refusal subspace is affine rather than linear, Wollschlager et al. [7] found it forms a cone structure, and Winninger [8] reported that Qwen3-8B requires at least three directions. Our finding that the community abliteration of Qwen3-4B uses one direction per layer, with cosine 0.016 between the shallowest and deepest layers, adds to this evidence that refusal is not a single global direction.

**Response-site safety signals.** Kwon [9] showed that refusal is "a shallow, response-site computation", reading harm directions at response positions with a causal effect. This response-site pathway is conceded here and not reclaimed. The same work reports a 24-prompt specificity control with a behavioural difference of +16.8 points, but never crosses the request f

actor with the response content systematically. HARC [10] defines a response-site readout (Eq. 2) that is substantially the same object as our r_content; our finding that |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.04 to 0.09 contradicts its claim that prompt-site and response-site directions "remain aligned" at 4B scale.

**Readability versus actionability.** Basu et al. [4] found a 53-point gap between probe AUROC (98.2%) and model flagging rate (45%) on clinical vignettes, with feature steering indistinguishable from a random control. This result motivates our design: a readable coordinate is not automatically a write-handle, so every claim about safety function requires either a causal intervention or a behavioural validation, not a probe alone.

**Defences against abliteration.** Abu Shairah et al. [3] trained on justify-then-refuse responses that distribute refusal across token positions, reporting at most 10% refusal drop under abliteration against 70 to 80 points for baselines. Muhamed et al. [11] proposed a post-hoc defence that poisons the attacker's contrastive direction estimator. Both confirm that the request-axis fitting step is where practitioners believe abliteration is vulnerable. Our work measures what the step leaves untouched rather than defending it.

**Output-aware monitoring.** Several lines of work add external monitors that read generated text: Schirmer et al. [12] threshold a real-time verifier signal with conformal risk control, Mitra [6] achieves AUROC 0.97 to 1.00 from response-time probes, and Chen et al. [13] fine-tune the model's own representations for monitorability. Aremu et al. [14] install an activation watermark readable across a response. These works add a monitor; none asks whether the model's own internal suppression is already output-conditioned.

**Decomposing the safety signal.** The work closest to ours in structure is the finding that LLMs encode harmfulness and refusal separately [15], which separates a harmfulness direction from a refusal direction and shows they are distinct. That work fits and reads both directions at prompt-side positions and never touches activations over generated text. Our decomposition separates what the request contributes from what the model's own output contributes, operating at response positions. The Entanglement Wall [16] crosses harmful against surface-matched benign requests using the same twin logic as our request factor, but runs entirely at prompt time.

**Safety-circuit localisation.** SafeSeek [17] identifies a safety circuit comprising 3.03% of heads and 0.79% of neurons. Yuan et al. [18] (DeRTa) train models to refuse at any response position. Zhang et al. [19] report alignment concentrating in assistant header tokens. These works locate safety spatially; our study locates it in terms of which coordinate carries the representation versus the action.

**Latent safety evaluation.** N-GLARE [20] computes a persistence scalar over 40+ models. LatentBiopsy [21] scores safety from a checkpoint's latent representations without sampling text. Luo et al. [5] report that internal harmfulness scores anti-rank jailbreaks at AUROC 0.220 and propose a content-independent measurement coordinate. Our cross-family panel tests whether any of five activation-based candidates can beat cheap logit baselines for prediction.

## 3 Method

### 3.1 Stimulus construction

We construct a factorial stimulus set from XSTest v2 [22], which provides 250 safe prompts across 10 types and 200 unsafe contrasts across 8 types. Six contrast families (homonyms, safe targets, safe contexts, definitions, figurative language, historical events) contain genuine minimal-edit twins: 150 tightly matched pairs where a harmful request and its benign twin differ in intent but not in surface vocabulary [ARTIFACT:art_jn337OmvTVjZ].

These 150 pairs are hash-split into 96 confirmatory and 54 held-out scenarios before any activations are collected. For each scenario, we construct response prefixes: exactly 144-token continuations where the action slot (a short phrase describing what the model does) 
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
intersects both an early response window (tokens 5-20) and a late window (tokens 40-55). Within each item and prefix family, the hazardous, benign, and placebo continuations have identical token counts at every index and differ only inside the action slot regions.

A separate fitting corpus of 64 continuation pairs, with zero shared action lemmas or 4-grams with the XSTest items, provides the training data for the response-content axis r_content.

### 3.2 Two-axis framework

We define two directions in activation space, each fitted by difference in means:

**Response-content axis (r_content).** Difference in means between hazardous and benign continuation tokens at response positions, computed under a held-fixed neutral request on the 64-pair fitting corpus. This direction measures what the model represents about the content it has already written.

**Request axis (r_ablit).** Difference in means over harmful versus harmless requests at the last prompt token, the direction that abliteration targets. This direction measures what the model computes about the request.

The critical instrument check is |cos(r_content, r_ablit)|. If this cosine is high, orthogonalising out the request axis would mechanically drive the response-content readout toward zero, and any post-edit measurement would be an algebraic residue rather than a finding about the model. We pre-register a gate at 0.50: above it, the lesion arm is confounded by construction.

### 3.3 Lesion protocol

We apply a rank-one orthogonalisation to every residual-stream write matrix (o_proj and down_proj, 72 matrices across 36 layers). For a weight matrix W and the request direction u, the edit is W <- W - alpha * u * (u^T W), applied as a forward hook for numerical precision. At alpha = 0 the edit is a bitwise no-op; at alpha = 1 the component along u is completely removed. Five edit strengths (alpha in {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}) trace the dose-response curve [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

Qwen3-4B has no bias terms in its output-projection and down-projection matrices and uses tied input/output embeddings, so the edit is exact and provably does not contaminate the logit outcome through the embedding path.

### 3.4 Cross-family prediction

To test whether activation-based readouts predict real safety behaviour, we assemble a panel of 21 scored checkpoints across 7 model families (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, SmolLM3, Granite, OLMo-2, TinyLlama, Phi-4-mini) at or below 4B parameters. From one teacher-forced harvest per checkpoint, we compute five candidate readouts and seven baselines. Behavioural ground truth (harmful-compliance rate, safe-engagement rate, over-refusal rate) comes from greedy generations judged by Gemini-2.5-flash-lite and audited by GPT-5-mini [ARTIFACT:art_rpTmjn5qclSY].

The transfer test is leave-one-family-out ridge prediction with pairwise ranking accuracy as the metric. A candidate passes if it exceeds the strongest baseline by at least 0.15 in ranking accuracy, with a family-clustered bootstrap 95% CI excluding zero, on at least 5 of 7 families.

## 4 Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Models

All checkpoints share the Qwen3 architecture (36 layers, hidden size 2560) and tokenizer. The primary set comprises:

- **Qwen3-4B-Base**: pretrained, no safety tuning (8.04 GB, bf16)
- **Qwen3-4B**: instruction-tuned with refusal-style preference tuning (8.04 GB, bf16)
- **Qwen3-4B-SafeRL**: safety-RL tuned, declared child of Qwen3-4B (8.04 GB, bf16)
- **mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated**: community abliteration (shipped F32, cast to bf16)
- **CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR**: non-safety fine-tune of Base
- **RandInit-4B**: architecture-identical randomly initialised control (seed 20260920)
- **Qwen3-4B-Base (plain protocol)**: Base run without the chat template

For the cross-family panel (Lane C), 21 checkpoints across 7 families, plus 2 sealed families withheld for iteration 2.

### 4.2 Activation harvest

Each checkpoint undergoes a single teacher-forced activation harvest: 1,913 forward passes (Lane A) or a comparable count (Lanes B and C), with zero generated tokens.
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
 Projections are computed onto r_content and r_ablit at each layer and position, yielding per-item four-cell scalars from the 2x2 crossing of request (harmful vs. benign twin) by response prefix (hazardous vs. benign).

The layer band is frozen at layers 14-22 (depth fraction 0.39-0.61) by maximising cross-fitted Cohen's d on the fitting corpus in Qwen3-4B alone, then held constant for all checkpoints.

### 4.3 Null calibration

Every cross-checkpoint quantity is reported in null-SD units: the per-item standard deviation of the same contrast computed under at least 20 random unit directions in that checkpoint. This unit is independent of item count and carries the checkpoint's own residual-stream and LayerNorm scale, addressing the fact that residual-stream norms differ between base (54.2), instruct (57.0), and randomly initialised (300.8) checkpoints.

### 4.4 Shuffled-label control

The most important control refits r_content on permuted hazardous/benign labels and reruns the entire pipeline 20 times. A term that does not exceed this shuffled-label band is not evidence of a label-specific coordinate, regardless of how many null-SD units large it is in the isotropic random-direction metric.

## 5 Results

### 5.1 The response-content and request axes are near-orthogonal

Across the seven checkpoints, |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| ranges from 0.04 to 0.09 at the frozen band (layers 14-22) for all chat-template arms, with maximum 0.19 over any single layer (Table 1). Base-plain, run without the chat template, reaches 0.24 at the band and 0.31 at its peak layer. The pre-registered gate at 0.50 passes in every checkpoint. What the model represents about the content of its response and what it computes about the harmfulness of the request are nearly perpendicular directions in activation space [ARTIFACT:art_2QM9uBviY4Wk].

**Table 1.** Cosine similarity between response-content and request axes.

| Checkpoint | |cos| at band | Max over layers |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-4B | 0.078 | 0.179 |
| Qwen3-4B-SafeRL | 0.087 | 0.187 |
| Qwen3-4B-Base (chat) | 0.066 | 0.175 |
| Qwen3-4B-Base (plain) | 0.235 | 0.313 |
| Qwen3-4B-abliterated | 0.043 | 0.119 |
| NonSafetyFT-STaR | 0.048 | 0.179 |
| RandInit-4B | 0.067 | 0.083 |

[FIGURE:fig_cosine]

### 5.2 The lesion removes the accumulator, not the percept

The rank-one lesion is verified exact: the raw projection gap along the request direction u falls as (1-alpha) to 0.02% of baseline at alpha = 1.0. Yet the harm representation survives completely. Table 2 shows the key quantities across the five-strength grid on Qwen3-4B [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

**Table 2.** Lesion dose-response on Qwen3-4B (instruct).

| alpha | Gap along u (norm.) | CV probe AUROC | 1-D AUROC on u | Benign NLL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.999 | 4.138 |
| 0.25 | 0.744 | 1.000 | 0.999 | 4.105 |
| 0.50 | 0.482 | 1.000 | 0.999 | 4.072 |
| 0.75 | 0.228 | 1.000 | 0.999 | 4.045 |
| 1.00 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.590 | 4.017 |

The cross-validated probe reads 1.000 across all strengths because the harm distinction is encoded redundantly in the 2559-dimensional orthogonal complement of u. Post-hoc removal of the top class direction from intact-model activations drops the probe from 1.000 to 0.800, but in the lesioned model (which was never allowed to write u at all) the complement reads 1.000. Removing 128 random directions costs nothing in either state.

This is not a normalisation artefact. The probe still reads 1.000 on unit-normalised activations after the lesion. The residual norm alone, which is a 0.985-AUROC harm detector in the intact model, flips to 0.167 (anti-predictive) after the lesion.

[FIGURE:fig_lesion_dose]

### 5.3 The request axis is an accumulator coordinate

Depth profiling reveals the mechanism. The harmful/harmless distinction reaches AUROC 1.000 by layer 13 in both the intact and lesioned models. In the intact model, the signal along u grows 138-fold from layer 13 (gap 0.34) to layer 22 (gap 47.05). The lesion zeroes this accumulation at every depth (gap 0.003 to 0.01 post-edit). The 
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
lesioned model's class direction is nearly identical to the intact one at shallow layers (cosine 0.985 at layer 13) and rotates to exact orthogonality only at the layer u was fitted at [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

The request axis is therefore an accumulator coordinate: the model progressively concentrates a distinction it already possesses into a specific direction. Abliteration deletes the accumulator. The percept was computed earlier, in a code the edit does not reach.

[FIGURE:fig_depth_profile]

### 5.4 Safety training doubles the separation and shifts it earlier

From 128 harmful and 128 harmless prompt-only forward passes per checkpoint, we fit the request axis at every layer and report the best layer's Cohen's d and depth fraction [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

**Table 3.** Request-axis separation by checkpoint.

| Checkpoint | Safety-tuned | Best layer | Depth fraction | Cohen's d |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-4B-Base | No | 29 | 0.806 | 5.68 |
| HintGen-STaR (FT of Base) | No | 29 | 0.806 | 5.74 |
| Qwen3-4B | Yes | 22 | 0.611 | 11.15 |
| Qwen3-4B-SafeRL | Yes | 23 | 0.639 | 11.41 |

Safety tuning roughly doubles the separation (5.7 to 11.2) and moves it seven layers earlier (depth 0.81 to 0.62). The non-safety fine-tune lands on top of its base parent (d = 5.74, same layer 29), confirming that the readout tracks safety tuning, not fine-tuning as such.

### 5.5 The community abliteration is per-layer, not global

Analysis of mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated reveals that while the edit is rank-one per matrix (median sigma_1^2 / ||Delta||_F^2 = 0.9945, implied alpha = 0.973), the direction rotates with depth. Adjacent-layer cosine has median 0.773, and the shallowest and deepest layers' directions are orthogonal (cosine 0.016). The community recipe is one direction per layer, not one global direction [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

### 5.6 Cross-lineage direction dissociation

Across trained checkpoints, the response-content axes are highly aligned (cosine 0.90-0.99), while the request axes diverge substantially. Instruct-to-SafeRL cosine is 0.896 for r_ablit but 0.992 for r_content. Instruct-to-abliterated cosine is 0.361 for r_ablit but 0.986 for r_content. Safety training moves the refusal axis and leaves the content axis alone; abliteration rotates the refusal axis away from its parent [ARTIFACT:art_2QM9uBviY4Wk].

[FIGURE:fig_direction_cosines]

### 5.7 The shuffled-label control refutes the arming interaction

The pre-registered arming decomposition (O, CB, A, T) was tested in Lane A across all seven checkpoints. The arming interaction term A reaches -4.3 to -9.3 null-SD, but refitting r_content on permuted labels and rerunning the pipeline reproduces |A| up to 11.0 to 11.8 null-SD. A does not escape the shuffled-label band in any checkpoint. By contrast, the response main effect T escapes in three of seven checkpoints, all three being non-safety arms [ARTIFACT:art_2QM9uBviY4Wk].

**Table 4.** Arming term versus shuffled-label control (EARLY window, null-SD units).

| Checkpoint | A (real) | A shuffled band (97.5%) | Escapes? | T (real) | T band | Escapes? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-4B | -7.48 | 11.78 | No | 9.09 | 10.63 | No |
| Qwen3-4B-SafeRL | -8.30 | 11.27 | No | 10.38 | 11.57 | No |
| Qwen3-4B-Base (chat) | -4.39 | 11.04 | No | 10.18 | 9.90 | Yes |
| Qwen3-4B-Base (plain) | -0.25 | 11.61 | No | 10.91 | 10.09 | Yes |
| Qwen3-4B-abliterated | -9.29 | 11.69 | No | 3.80 | 8.46 | No |
| NonSafetyFT-STaR | -4.25 | 11.47 | No | 10.48 | 9.26 | Yes |
| RandInit-4B | 0.35 | 1.27 | No | -0.01 | 1.13 | No |

This is the single most important negative result: a diff-in-means direction fitted on permuted labels reproduces an interaction-shaped term of the same magnitude in every trained checkpoint. The shuffled-label band collapses to 1.27 in the randomly initialised arm, confirming the width is a property of trained representations, not of the measurement procedure.

[FIGURE:fig_shuffled_label]

### 5.8 Only the benign-only footprint passes the specificity screen

Five candidate readouts were screened (
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
S1) for safety-specificity: each must exceed both non-safety arms on its registered term by 0.50 null-SD with intervals excluding zero. Only K3 (benign-only activation footprint) passes, with margins +1.07 and +0.74 null-SD over the two non-safety arms. K1 (arming), K2 (prior+slope), K4 (persistence), and K5 (domain profile) fail [ARTIFACT:art_2QM9uBviY4Wk].

K3 is notable because it requires no harmful prompt: the footprint measures how a checkpoint's benign activations differ from the base model's. Its weight-only companion, mean stable rank over the layer band, separates trained models (216.3) from random initialisation (977.4) with no forward pass at all.

### 5.9 No activation-based readout beats the logit baseline cross-family

Across the 21-checkpoint, 7-family panel, the strongest cross-family predictor of both safe-engagement rate and harmful-compliance rate is baseline B3, the first-token refusal-logit gap, at 0.851 and 0.863 respectively. The best activation candidate, K1 (arming decomposition), reaches 0.671 and 0.810. The margin is -0.180 for safe-engagement (95% CI: [-0.310, -0.046]). No candidate passes the S3 decision rule [ARTIFACT:art_rpTmjn5qclSY].

Machinery controls confirm the test is well-calibrated: oracle ranking accuracy is 1.00, random baseline is 0.556, and shuffle baseline is 0.585.

**Table 5.** Cross-family prediction accuracy (leave-one-family-out).

| Method | Safe-engagement | Harmful-compliance | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| B3: Refusal-logit gap | 0.851 | 0.863 | Logit |
| B2: Refusal rate | 0.760 | 0.810 | Behavioural |
| B4: Prompt-axis Fisher | 0.753 | 0.837 | Activation |
| B6: Raw-hidden geometry | 0.723 | 0.745 | Activation |
| K1: Arming decomposition | 0.671 | 0.810 | Activation |
| B5: r_request projection | 0.541 | 0.720 | Activation |
| B1: Card/name regex | 0.503 | 0.517 | Metadata |
| B7: N-GLARE reimpl. | 0.414 | 0.366 | Activation |

[FIGURE:fig_cross_family]

Within the Qwen3-4B trio, the arming term A cleanly orders Base (-2.32) < Instruct (+0.18) < SafeRL (+1.90). SafeRL achieves 0% harmful-compliance and 0% refusal, which refusal-based baselines cannot predict; the arming signal detects this internally. But this within-family ordering does not transfer to other families at this panel size.

### 5.10 Replication on the SafeRL lineage

The lesion replicates on Qwen3-4B-SafeRL. Post-hoc removal of the top class direction drops the probe from 1.000 to 0.799 (intact) and 0.788 (lesioned), matching the instruct arm (0.800 and 0.778). The residual norm flips from 0.997-AUROC (intact) to 0.261 (lesioned) in both lineages. The signal along u grows approximately 250-fold with depth in SafeRL versus 138-fold in the instruct model, but dividing by each checkpoint's mean residual norm equalises the two (0.601 vs. 0.594), confirming that the difference is a scale artefact [ARTIFACT:art_2sz7g3MD4_y3].

## 6 Discussion and Limitations

### 6.1 What abliteration does and does not remove

The central finding is a dissociation between representation and action. The request axis u is an accumulator coordinate into which the model progressively concentrates a harm/harmless distinction that is already present at shallower layers. Abliteration deletes this accumulator. The underlying representation, encoded redundantly in the orthogonal complement, survives completely.

This explains the community observation that some abliterated checkpoints "start answering, hesitate mid-paragraph and talk themselves out of it": the model retains its ability to recognise harm in its own output even after losing its initial refusal response. It also aligns with Abu Shairah et al. [3], who showed that distributing refusal across response positions makes models abliteration-resistant. Our finding provides the mechanistic basis: a model with safety distributed beyond the accumulator coordinate has less to lose when that coordinate is deleted.

### 6.2 Why the arming term failed

The pre-registered arming interaction A, intended to separate request-gated monitoring from unconditional monitoring, did not surviv
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
e the shuffled-label control. A diff-in-means direction fitted on noise produces an interaction of comparable magnitude in every trained checkpoint. This does not mean the arming concept is wrong, only that the diff-in-means readout is too unstable to measure it: split-half cosine of the fitted direction was 0.35-0.39, far below the 0.70 gate. A supervised probe (AUROC 0.97-0.98) recovers the distinction, but was registered as a fallback readout, not as the primary screen.

### 6.3 The logit baseline

That the first-token refusal-logit gap is the strongest cross-family predictor, outperforming all activation-based candidates, is an informative negative result. The gap is cheap (one token, no generation, no judge), well-defined across architectures, and directly measures the model's propensity to refuse. Activation-based readouts may carry richer information within a family, but the family-specific nature of internal representations prevents transfer at this panel size. Whether a larger and more diverse panel would change this outcome is an open question.

### 6.4 Limitations

**Scale.** All findings are on checkpoints at or below 4B parameters. The orthogonality of r_content and r_ablit, the accumulator structure, and the survival of the representation under lesion may not hold at larger scale.

**Single family for the lesion study.** The lesion was applied only to Qwen3-4B variants. Different architectures or training recipes could produce different outcomes.

**Shuffled-label sensitivity.** The shuffled-label band width (|A| up to 11-12 null-SD) in trained checkpoints means any arming-shaped term measured with a diff-in-means readout cannot be distinguished from noise at this axis stability. Higher-dimensional readouts may recover the signal.

**LLM judging.** Behavioural ground truth uses a single LLM judge audited by a second. Inter-rater kappa is 0.71 for refusal, 0.57 for harmful content, and 0.47 for on-topic help. Safe-engagement, the co-primary target and the hardest column to grade, carries the most judge noise.

**Instrument failure.** The split-half cosine of the diff-in-means axis (G1) failed in every checkpoint (0.35-0.39 vs. the 0.70 threshold). The registered fallback (supervised probe) was used, but this means all results using r_content rest on an axis with documented instability.

**Registered damage variable.** In Lane B, the pre-registered primary damage variable (matched-damage comparison) is flat at ceiling: no alpha produces the expected damage, so the registered comparison is indeterminate. Results at alpha = 1.0 are reported as a labelled full-annihilation companion, not as the registered matched-damage test.

## 7 Conclusion

Abliteration removes the model's refusal action, not its harm representation. The direction it deletes is an accumulator coordinate, not the locus of the percept: the harmful/harmless distinction reaches near-perfect decodability well before the accumulator begins to concentrate it, and the model encodes harm redundantly in the 2559-dimensional orthogonal complement of the deleted direction. Safety training doubles the request-axis separation and shifts it earlier in the network. These findings are specific to the Qwen3-4B family and to the rank-one lesion protocol tested here, and the arming interaction that was predicted to separate request-gated from unconditional monitoring did not survive its own shuffled-label control. The first-token refusal-logit gap remains the strongest cross-family predictor of safety behaviour, setting the bar that any activation-based safety metric must clear.

Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

- [MAJOR] (evidence) BLOCKING. The causal half of the paper's central claim was never measured. The title, Contribution 2 and the Conclusion's opening sentence all assert that abliteration removes the refusal ACTION. In Lane B (art_2sz7g3MD4_y3), results.json['causal_arm'] is the empty object {}; 7 of the 8 causal jobs crashed before producing output (logs/causal_L1_0.0.log, causal_L1_1.0, causal_L3_0.0, causal_L3_1.0, causal_L4_0.0, causal_L4_1.0 all die with ".venv/bin/python: No such file or directory"; causal_L2_1.0.log dies with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'typing_extensions'). The only surviving causal output is out/causal/L2_a0.00.json, the UNLESIONED alpha=0 baseline, whose own refusal-drive numbers (5.5e-4 harmful, 8.4e-4 benign) the artifact's FINDINGS.md F11 describes as sitting at a floor. Zero tokens were generated anywhere in the artifact. No refusal rate, harmful-compliance rate, generated text or logit outcome exists for any lesioned model at any alpha. The paper does not disclose this, and the artifact's own deviations ledger does not record it either. Compounding it, the only damage evidence that does exist points the other way: t

<pasted_content id="43a0">
he pre-registered primary damage variable is flat at 1.000 for every alpha (metadata_alpha_star = null, source 'NONE - both registered damage variables are flat'), every s2_registered_signature_tests row reads INDETERMINATE_NO_MATCHED_POINT, and benign NLL improves monotonically 4.138 -> 4.017 as alpha rises.
  Action: Repair the two trivial environment faults (missing venv interpreter, missing typing_extensions) and re-run the causal arm, generating greedy completions for the alpha grid and grading them with the judge pipeline Lane C already implements -- this yields the refusal-rate-vs-alpha curve the claim requires. If that is not possible this iteration, rewrite the title, Contribution 2 and the Conclusion to the measured claim only ('a rank-one lesion that zeroes the request axis at every depth leaves harm decodability at ceiling'), and add an explicit sentence in Results -- not buried in Sec. 6.4 -- stating that no behavioural consequence of the lesion was measured and that the registered damage comparison returned INDETERMINATE on all rows.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) BLOCKING for novelty. The paper's headline dissociation is already published twice, and neither source is cited at the point the claim is made. arXiv:2603.27412 (Llorente-Saguer, 'The Geometry of Harmful Intent') evaluates Qwen base / instruction-tuned / ABLITERATED triplets and states in its abstract: 'geometry survives refusal ablation: both abliterated variants achieve AUROC at most 0.015 below their instruction-tuned counterparts, establishing a geometric dissociation between harmful-intent representation and the downstream generative refusal mechanism.' That is this paper's headline, verbatim in substance. arXiv:2604.18901 (same author, 12 models, four families, base/instruct/abliterated) reports abliterated variants matching instruct within +/-0.003 AUROC. The paper cites the first only as [21] -- under a fabricated title, 'LatentBiopsy' -- and describes it merely as a competing latent safety evaluator; the second is absent from the reference list entirely. The run's own prior-art dossier (art_CC5kC0-E3lXW, research_report.md line 21) had already flagged exactly this: "'harm recognition survives abliteration' is published twice [5][10] and any rediscovery is a replication."
  Action: Cite both papers in the Introduction at the point the dissociation is introduced, state plainly that the dissociation itself is a replication of theirs on a new family (Qwen3-4B) with a new instrument (a dose-graded rank-one lesion rather than a checkpoint comparison), and move the paper's novelty claim to the MECHANISM those papers do not provide: the accumulator structure of Sec. 5.3 (harm decodable at AUROC ~1.000 by layer 13 in both states; the signal along u growing 138-fold from gap 0.336 at layer 13 to 47.05 at layer 22; lesioned-vs-intact class direction at cosine 0.985 at layer 13 rotating to orthogonality only at the fitted layer). Reframed this way the prior work becomes the paper's motivation rather than its scoop.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Contribution 1's headline cosine is unstable across the run's own three lanes, and only the smallest value is reported. The same conceptual quantity, |cos(response-content axis, request/abliteration axis)|, measures 0.078 in Lane A (Table 1, metadata.cos_table), 0.159 pooled / 0.175 max in Lane B (results.json.integrity_gates.L2.G1_cos_r_content_vs_r_ablit_pooled / G1_max), and 0.34-0.60 with mean 0.475 across all 21 checkpoints in Lane C (results/per_ckpt/*.json, instrument.cos_rcontent_rrequest -- 0.469 for Qwen3-4B itself, 0.594 for Qwen3-4B-Base, 0.479 for SafeRL). Lane C's own summary and lc_harvest.py both identify r_request as 'the abliteration/request axis'. The paper reports only the 0.04-0.09 figure, never mentions the 21-checkpoint measurement -- which is far larger and more diverse and would support the OPPOSITE reading -- and uses the smallest number to claim it contradicts HARC.
  Action: Report all three measurements in a single table with their differing protocols (Lane A: 7-checkpoint single-family, 64-pair fitt

ing corpus, band 14-22; Lane B: pooled over band 13-21; Lane C: per-checkpoint refit, 21 checkpoints, 7 families, hidden sizes 1024-3072), and state the honest scope: near-orthogonality is a property of the single-family Qwen3-4B fit and does not hold at panel scale. Then re-derive whatever the lesion arm needs from Lane B's 0.159/0.175 explicitly, since that is the number governing that arm's confound gate.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper misreads HARC and claims a contradiction that does not exist. Sec. 2 asserts that |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| = 0.04-0.09 'contradicts its claim that prompt-site and response-site directions remain aligned at 4B scale.' HARC's actual sentence (arXiv:2607.00572, Sec. 3.2) reads: 'same-concept cross-position pairs (v_harm with v_harm^resp, and v_ref with v_ref^resp) remain aligned, while cross-concept pairs are near-orthogonal at the most decoupled layer.' r_content (response-site content harm) vs r_ablit (prompt-site request/refusal) is a CROSS-CONCEPT, cross-position pair -- precisely the pair HARC says is near-orthogonal. HARC also prints Qwen cross-position cosines of 0.19/0.10 at L12 and 0.31/0.30 at L27, consistent with this paper's numbers. The run's own research artifact reached this conclusion before the experiments ran ('the gate is expected to PASS ... report it as a result, just not a surprising one'). Misrepresenting a cited source's claim in order to manufacture a contradiction is the kind of error that costs a paper its credibility with the one reviewer who knows that source.
  Action: Delete the 'contradicts HARC' sentence in Sec. 2 and replace it with an accurate statement: HARC reports near-orthogonality for cross-concept pairs and 0.19-0.31 cross-position cosines on Qwen, and this paper's 0.04-0.09 at Qwen3-4B is consistent with that, confirming the lesion arm is not confounded by construction. Demote Contribution 1 from a finding to a passed instrument gate (which is exactly how Lane B's prereg treats it) and promote the depth mechanism into the vacated slot.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The Method section describes a stimulus substrate that did not produce the paper's results. Sec. 3.1 states 'exactly 144-token continuations' with the action slot intersecting windows at tokens 5-20 and 40-55. That describes the dataset artifact (art_jn337OmvTVjZ; prereg.json continuation_length_tokens = 144, all metadata_n_tokens = 144). But Lane A -- the artifact behind Tables 1 and 4 and Secs. 5.1, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 -- never reads that artifact: lane_a/substrate.py builds its own stimuli from the raw XSTest CSV with TOTAL_L = 80 ('every evaluation prefix is exactly this many tokens'), FIRST_SLOT = 8, SECOND_SLOT = 46. Two structurally different, independently constructed substrates exist, and the paper describes the one that did NOT generate its headline numbers. Relatedly, the paper cites the dataset artifact for its construction while not disclosing that that artifact FAILED its own prefix-hazard identification gate (0.9429 against a 0.95 threshold), dropping its confirmatory set from 96 to 85 items, nor that its placebo distance gate failed (median edit-distance ratio 1.25 against a required <=1.10), nor that only 4 of 6 contrast families are genuinely surface-minimal, nor that no human rater exists anywhere in the pipeline.
  Action: Rewrite Sec. 3.1 to describe the substrate Lane A actually ran (80-token frames, action tokens pinned at positions 8 and 46, n = 96 confirmatory) and state in one sentence that a separate 144-token substrate was constructed for other lanes, with the read windows that each uses. Add a short Sec. 4 paragraph reporting the dataset artifact's failed gates (hazard identification 0.9429 vs 0.95 with n dropping 96 -> 85; placebo median ratio 1.25 vs <=1.10; 4 of 6 families surface-minimal; LLM raters substituting for human raters). Disclosing these costs nothing -- the paper's honesty elsewhere is its main asset -- and concealing them makes every other construction claim suspect.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The lesion's primary outcome is at ceiling in the control condition
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
, so 'the representation survives' was never falsifiable. Table 2's CV probe AUROC reads 1.000 at alpha = 0 and 1.000 at every subsequent alpha. An outcome that is already saturated in the unperturbed model cannot distinguish 'the lesion left the representation intact' from 'the outcome has no dynamic range'. This is the same fact as the artifact's own report that the pre-registered primary damage variable is flat (metadata_alpha_star = null; all s2_registered_signature_tests rows INDETERMINATE_NO_MATCHED_POINT) and that benign NLL actually improves monotonically with alpha. The paper acknowledges the registered test is indeterminate in the last bullet of Sec. 6.4, then presents the ceiling reading as the headline finding in the Conclusion.
  Action: Re-report the lesion with an outcome that has headroom, and state a power claim. Candidates already computable from the harvested activations: TPR at 1% FPR (the metric arXiv:2604.18901 shows varies by >10x the AUROC gap and argues should be the default in safety detection); probe AUROC under a restricted labelled budget (n = 16/32/64); or transfer AUROC of the intact-model probe applied unchanged to lesioned activations. Add one sentence of the form 'with this outcome, a degradation of X would have been detected at power 0.8', and move the INDETERMINATE verdict from Sec. 6.4 into Sec. 5.2 where the claim is made.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Contribution 4's headline number is misattributed and cherry-picked. The paper states the arming decomposition 'achieves 0.882 ranking accuracy on harmful-compliance from just 4 prompts within the Qwen3 family'. In the artifact, 0.882 is candidates.K1.budget_curve['4'] for harmful_compliance_rate -- the k = 4 point of the CROSS-FAMILY leave-one-family-out curve averaged over all seven held-out families, not a within-Qwen3 number. The full curve is 0.882 (k=4), 0.850 (k=8), 0.789 (k=16), 0.814 (k=32), 0.810 (k=96): non-monotonic and ending well below where it starts. No confidence interval is computed at any individual k (the bootstrap CI applies only to the k=96 mean), there is no correction for having scanned five values of k and reported the maximum, and lc_analyze.py's own decision rule records smallest_k_pass: null for both targets, i.e. this point never registers as a pass by the paper's own criterion. A maximum over a five-point scan that runs backwards in k is far more consistent with noise than with a few-prompt capability.
  Action: Replace the claim with the full budget curve plus per-k family-clustered bootstrap CIs, and state explicitly that accuracy does not increase with prompt count and that smallest_k_pass is null. If the curve is flat within CI, say that the readout is insensitive to prompt budget in this range -- an honest and still-interesting statement -- rather than presenting its maximum as a few-prompt result. Also correct 'within the Qwen3 family' to 'cross-family leave-one-family-out'.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) Sec. 5.9 states a fact that the run's own judged ground truth contradicts: 'SafeRL achieves 0% harmful-compliance and 0% refusal.' The 0% harmful-compliance is correct (behavioural_columns['Qwen__Qwen3-4B-SafeRL'].harmful_compliance_rate = 0.0). The 0% refusal is the REGEX baseline B2 (regex_refusal_harm = 0.0). The actual judged refusal rate, computed directly from results/judged/Qwen__Qwen3-4B-SafeRL.jsonl, is 88.9% (40 of 45 harm-set prompts marked refused by the primary judge), with a 33.3% over-refusal rate on the benign set. The paper asserts the opposite of its own measurement, and it does so in the sentence that motivates why an internal readout is needed.
  Action: Rewrite as: 'SafeRL refuses 88.9% of harm-set prompts by the LLM judge, but its declines are non-lexical safe completions, so a regex refusal detector scores it at 0% -- exactly the failure mode an internal readout should cover.' This is both true and a strictly stronger motivation for the paper's own thesis than the current sentence.
- [MAJOR] (clarity) The paper has no Abstract. It opens directly at '## 1 Introduction'. An expert reader cannot g

et the main finding from the abstract, the main results table and the first results figure, because the first of those does not exist. Compounding this, the results are written in a private code -- K1-K5, S1/S3, G1-G6, B1-B7, O/CB/A/T -- that is never defined in a table, and the same baseline labels mean DIFFERENT things in different lanes (B3 is cluster separation in Lane A but the first-token refusal-logit gap in Lane C; B4 is the refusal-logit gap in Lane A but prompt-axis Fisher in Lane C). Tables 4 and 5 and Secs. 5.7-5.9 are effectively unreadable without opening the artifacts.
  Action: Write an Abstract carrying the four headline numbers (the cosine with its scope, the probe AUROC across the alpha grid with the 1-D collapse 0.999 -> 0.590, the Cohen's d doubling 5.7 -> 11.2 with the layer shift 29 -> 22, and the B3 0.851/0.863 vs K1 0.671/0.810 cross-family margin). Add a notation table in Sec. 4 defining every K, S, G, B and term code on first use, and give the Lane A and Lane C baselines non-colliding names.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) Sec. 5.6's cross-lineage narrative omits two numbers from the same source table that undercut it. The paper reports Instruct->SafeRL r_ablit cosine 0.896 and Instruct->abliterated 0.361 and concludes that 'safety training moves the refusal axis and leaves the content axis alone; abliteration rotates the refusal axis away from its parent.' The same Lane A table (metadata.cross_checkpoint_directions) also contains Base->Instruct r_ablit = 0.200 and Base-chat vs abliterated r_ablit = 0.041, neither of which appears in the paper. Ordinary instruction tuning rotates the request axis MORE (0.200) than community abliteration rotates it relative to its instruct parent (0.361), which removes the distinctiveness the section claims for abliteration.
  Action: Print the full cross-checkpoint cosine matrix as a table or heatmap figure rather than four hand-picked cells, and rewrite the conclusion to what the full matrix supports: the request axis is unstable across ALL lineage steps including ordinary instruction tuning (0.200), while the content axis is stable across every trained pair (0.90-0.99). The content-axis stability is the robust half of the finding and survives intact.
- [MAJOR] (scope) The commissioned metric is never evaluated on the model the request named. The user asked for an activation/weight-only metric that reads a single model and returns a safety evaluation, with the abliterated checkpoint as one of the three target models. Table 3, the metric table, has four rows -- Base, HintGen-STaR, Instruct, SafeRL -- and does NOT include mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated. So the proposed metric has never been asked the question it exists to answer: does it flag an uncensored checkpoint? The published prior (arXiv:2603.27412, arXiv:2604.18901) predicts approximately zero effect on exactly this pair, which the run's own dossier flagged as something every lane's power calculation had to account for. Relatedly, the Conclusion's final sentence elevates the first-token refusal-logit gap -- a logit-only readout the commissioning invariant explicitly designates a baseline and not a result -- to the paper's closing claim.
  Action: Add the abliterated row to Table 3. It costs 128 harmful + 128 harmless prompt-only forward passes, which is the cheapest experiment in the paper, and it is the metric's decisive test. Report the answer either way: if the abliterated checkpoint retains Instruct's d ~ 11 at layer 22, state plainly that the metric tracks safety TRAINING but does not detect abliteration, and that this is a real limit on the commissioned use case. Then rewrite the Conclusion's last sentence so the baseline is framed as the bar to clear rather than as the paper's result.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) Four Lane A gate outcomes that bear directly on the reported claims are omitted from the paper. (a) G5, the placebo TOST equivalence gate, FAILS in all seven checkpoints including the random-init arm -- entirely absent from the paper. (b) G6 licenses the subtraction only in the non-safety arms, so Lane A's own SU

<pasted_content id="43a0">
MMARY marks Qwen3-4B's arming term A as an upper bound; the paper never mentions A_net or this caveat. (c) The achieved minimum detectable effect is 0.65-1.99 against a registered threshold of 0.50, meaning all seven checkpoints were under-powered for the S1 screen; Sec. 6.4 discusses G1 and shuffled-label width but never states these numbers. (d) K3, the sole S1 survivor the paper promotes in Sec. 5.8, has ci95 = [NaN, NaN] and ci_excludes_zero = false in s1_table -- it does not satisfy the registered rule the paper itself states in Sec. 3.4 ('margins ... with intervals excluding zero'). The paper reports K3's margins (+1.07, +0.74) and its PASS without the undefined CI.
  Action: Add a gates table to Sec. 4 or 5 listing every registered gate with its threshold, observed value and verdict (G1 FAIL 0.352-0.387 vs 0.70; G3 PASS 0.88-0.95; G5 FAIL all arms; G6 mixed; MDE 0.65-1.99 vs 0.50). Restate K3's Sec. 5.8 status as 'margin positive, CI undefined -- does not meet the registered criterion', or drop the PASS. A paper whose best feature is that it reports its own refutations loses that credit the moment a reviewer finds four more failures in the artifacts that the paper did not mention.
- [MAJOR] (clarity) Five references carry titles or author lists that do not match the cited works, which I verified directly against arXiv. [1] Arditi et al. 2406.11717: 'D. Guo, R. Balestriero, C. Szegedy' are not authors; the real co-authors are Paleka, Panickssery, Gurnee and Nanda. [2] 2411.09003 is 'Refusal in LLMs is an Affine Function' by Marshall, Scherlis and Belrose, not 'Refusal Abliteration Is Not What You Think'. [7] 2502.17420 is 'The Geometry of Refusal in Large Language Models: Concept Cones and Representational Independence' by Wollschlaeger, Elstner, Geisler, Cohen-Addad, Guennemann and Gasteiger; 'Sterz and Kersting' are not authors and the cited title does not exist. [20] 2511.14195 is 'N-GLARE: An Non-Generative Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator', not 'Neural Generalized Linear Assessment of Response Elicitation'. [21] 2603.27412 is 'The Geometry of Harmful Intent: Training-Free Anomaly Detection via Angular Deviation in LLM Residual Streams' by Llorente-Saguer. In addition, references [23]-[33] are never cited anywhere in the text, and [15], the paper's closest structural relative, is given with no authors (Zhao, Huang, Wu, Bau, Shi).
  Action: Regenerate the bibliography from verified metadata rather than from memory -- fetch each arXiv abstract page and copy the title and author list exactly. Cite or delete [23]-[33]; several of them ([32], the 273-checkpoint abliteration audit; [33], HRCI) are prior art the paper should actively engage in Sec. 2 and Sec. 5.5, not list in silence.
- [MINOR] (evidence) Two smaller reporting gaps in Lane C. (a) The machinery controls quoted in Sec. 5.9 (oracle 1.00, random 0.556, shuffle 0.585) are computed ONLY for safe_engagement_rate; machinery_controls is literally null for harmful_compliance_rate in s3_results.json, because lc_analyze.py guards the computation with a target check. The paper cites them as if they calibrate both targets. (b) The truth columns are highly compressed -- safe_engagement_rate spans 0.000 to 0.178 with std 0.052 across 21 checkpoints -- so the co-primary target on which the method most clearly loses is also the one with the least spread and, per the artifact, the worst judge agreement (kappa 0.47 on on_topic_help).
  Action: State that machinery controls were computed for safe-engagement only, and either run them for harmful-compliance or restrict the calibration claim. Report the min/max/std of each truth column in the setup so a reader can see that safe-engagement ranges over 0-0.18, and add one sentence noting that the target with the narrowest spread and the noisiest judge column is where the margin is largest -- which is the charitable reading the paper is entitled to make for its own candidate.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Baseline B7 is a self-made reimplementation of a peer-reviewed competitor, reported at 0.414/0.366 -- below the 0

<pasted_content id="43a0">
.556 random floor -- with no caveat in Table 5. The run's own research artifact records that N-GLARE has no public code and that JSS is 'NOT implementable' in this iteration, and the Lane C summary labels B7 'not the authors' code'. Presenting an unvalidated reimplementation of another group's published method at below-chance accuracy, without that label in the table itself, is unfair to that work and invites an obvious rebuttal.
  Action: Annotate the B7 row in Table 5 as 'reimplementation; the authors' code is not public and this implementation was not validated against their reported results', and add a sentence in Sec. 5.9 saying the comparison could not be run faithfully. Costs nothing and removes an easy attack.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Two instrument descriptions conflict across the paper. Sec. 4.2 gives one frozen layer band (14-22, depth 0.39-0.61) as though it applied throughout, but Lane B ran 13-21 (out/pilot.json band = [13..21], depth 0.36-0.61). Sec. 6.4 states that the split-half cosine of r_content 'failed in every checkpoint (0.35-0.39)' and concludes that 'all results using r_content rest on an axis with documented instability' -- but that is Lane A's axis only; Lane B's r_content split-half cosine is 0.9275 (per-layer 0.818-0.945, PASS against the same 0.70 gate) and Lane C's is ~0.95. Three lanes fit three different axes under one name, with opposite stability verdicts.
  Action: Report the band and the split-half cosine per lane in the Experimental Setup, in a small table. Then narrow the Sec. 6.4 limitation to what is true: the Lane A arming screen rests on an unstable axis (0.35-0.39), which is why its registered readout failed, while the Lane B lesion arm's axis is stable (0.927). As written the limitation overstates the damage to the lesion result and understates the specificity of the Lane A failure.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Figure coverage and specification. Seven figure markers appear with no captions in the draft, so none can be judged as self-contained. Contribution 3 (Sec. 5.4, Table 3 -- safety training doubles the separation and shifts it earlier) is a major claim with no figure behind it, as is Sec. 5.8's S1 screen. There is no diagram anywhere in Sec. 3 (Method); the only conceptual figure, fig_overview, sits at the end of the Introduction, which is correct for a hero but leaves the two-axis framework and the lesion protocol undrawn at the point they are defined.
  Action: Write self-contained captions for all seven figures. Add a results figure for Sec. 5.4 -- a two-panel chart of Cohen's d by layer per checkpoint plus best-layer depth fraction -- which would also make the STaR control's coincidence with its base parent visible. Add a small schematic in Sec. 3 showing the 2x2 crossing and where each axis is fitted and read. Consider replacing the four hand-picked cells of Sec. 5.6 with a cross-checkpoint cosine heatmap, which is the chart type that matches that data relationship.

Use it for the field's landscape, prior work, crowded lanes, and the novelty bar — consult it while revising so the updated hypothesis stays genuinely novel and well-positioned.

<ambition>
THIS APPLIES IN ANY FIELD — linguistics, political science, economics, history,
biology, mathematics, computer science, or any mix of them. Where an example
below names a unit of study, read it as whatever your field's equivalent is:
languages, elections, markets, periods, corpora, species, model families, proof
techniques.

THE DEFAULT DELIVERABLE IS A NOVEL CONTRIBUTION. When the request does not name
a methodology, a deliverable, or a specific thing to compare, that silence is
NOT permission to produce something smaller — a literature overview, a report,
a survey, a descriptive table, a brief comparison. It means the choice of
contribution is yours, and the thing to produce is original research with a
finding of its own. Only an explicit request for a review or a replication
changes that.

CALIBRATE AMBITION TO WHAT THE REQUEST LEAVES OPEN. Whatever the request does
not pin down is yours to decide, and every degree of freedom it leaves you is
one to spend on ambition rather than on safety. A fully specified request is a
brief; an open-ended one is an invitation, and answering it with the smallest
defensible study wastes it.

THE TARGET is the most ambitious claim you can still expect to LAND — to finish
within the available resources with a non-trivial, genuinely insightful,
POSITIVE result. Both halves bind. Ambition that cannot land produces a
negative result about a question nobody asked; a guaranteed landing with no
ambition produces a measurement. Aim at the frontier between the two and take
the most ambitious point on it you can name a mechanism for.

WHAT DOES NOT COUNT as answering an open question:
- Applying an established measure, instrument, or method to MORE cases — more
  models, languages, periods, countries, corpora, datasets, or settings. The
  contribution is a table, and the reader learns nothing they could not have
  guessed.
- Proposing a variant of an existing method with no mechanistic reason to
  expect it to behave differently, then reporting that it did not. The negative
  result is then about an arbitrary choice, not about the world.
- Re-describing a known effect in new vocabulary, or naming it.
- A survey, a ranking, or a replication — unless that is what was asked for.

WHAT DOES: a claim that, if it holds, changes what someone in the field would
DO or would BELIEVE. Test it before committing: write the one-sentence finding
you expect to state at the end. If that sentence would not surprise an expert,
or would not change anyone's next decision, the hypothesis is not ambitious
enough — discard it and pick a harder one.

POSITIVE BY DESIGN, NOT BY LUCK. Prefer a claim you have a MECHANISM-level
reason to expect: something about how the phenomenon works that PREDICTS the
effect, not a hunch that it might appear. A hypothesis whose outcome is a coin
flip is a bet, and half of those bets end with nothing to report. Where the
direction genuinely cannot be known in advance, design the study so BOTH
outcomes are informative — then the finding is the mechanism rather than the
direction, and the result is positive either way.

SCALE THE CLAIM, NOT THE AMBITION, when resources bind. If the ambitious
version does not fit the budget, do NOT retreat to a measurement study. Narrow
what the claim COVERS — one language instead of twenty, one period, one
population, one model family — while keeping the mechanism it is about inta

A sharp, narrow, surprising result beats a broad, safe, unsurprising one in
every field.
</ambition>

<evidence_state_and_move>
This is iteration 1 of 5. There are 4 iteration(s) AFTER this one.
Your revision is the ONLY thing that decides where the next iteration points,
so work the two steps below in order and do not skip to a conclusion.

STEP 1 — CLASSIFY THE EVIDENCE. Set `evidence_state` to exactly one of:

- "strong_survivor": an artifact that ACTUALLY RAN produced a result that
  supports the claim, at a size the original ask would recognise as an
  answer, and it survived the obvious alternative explanations — the
  baseline, the confound, the simpler account.
- "weak_or_null": the test ran and gave you nothing to build on. No effect,
  an effect you cannot distinguish from the baseline or from noise, or an
  effect so much smaller than the ask implied that reporting it would answer
  a different question than the one asked.
- "experiment_broken": the test never tested the claim. A defect in the code,
  the data, the measure, the sample or the setup — including a run that did
  not finish, or numbers that were projected rather than executed. The claim
  is UNTESTED here, not refuted.

STEP 2 — READ THE MOVE OFF THE STATE. Set `move` by this rule. It is a
lookup, not a judgement — the judgement was STEP 1:

- "strong_survivor" -> `deepen` (why does it hold — the mechanism, the
  boundary where it stops) or `extend` (where else does it hold — a new
  population, period, language, species, market, model family, case set).
- "weak_or_null" AND at least one iteration remains -> `widen`. MANDATORY.
  Not "consider widening". This is the decision the audit found being missed
  every single time.
- "experiment_broken" -> `fix`. Keep the claim EXACTLY as it is, name the
  defect precisely in `move_rationale`, and say what a correct test looks
  like. Do not reframe, soften or re-scope a claim that was never tested —
  that hides the defect behind a new hypothesis.
- `declare` (write the run up as a negative result) ONLY when this is the
  final iteration, or no budget remains to test anything further. A clean
  null is a last resort, not a deliverable, and it is never the right move
  while an untried candidate and an iteration both exist.

HOW TO WIDEN, when the rule says widen:

1. Go back to the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK — not to the hypothesis you just
   refuted. The refuted hypothesis was one answer to that ask; the ask is
   still open.
2. Enumerate a POPULATION of candidate answers to it — alternative claims,
   alternative mechanisms that would produce the observed non-result,
   alternative measures of the same thing, alternative bodies of evidence,
   alternative comparisons. Aim for many and cheap, not one and careful.
   Write down how many you weighed.
3. Propose a CHEAP SCREEN that tests all of them at once, coarsely, at a cost
   comparable to one deep test — and a HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION that the screen
   never saw, for whichever candidate survives it.
4. The revised hypothesis is then EITHER the single best surviving candidate,
   stated as a claim, OR — if the screen still has to be run — an explicit
   SCREENING hypothesis that names the population and the selection rule.
   Both are legitimate outputs of a widen; a restatement of the old claim is
   not.

<narrow_salvage_ban>
The failure this procedure exists to stop: a weak or null first result, and
the revision quietly shrinks the claim until whatever effect the data did
show becomes the claim — a smaller population, a milder verb, a subgroup, a
weaker measure, an effect in the direction everyone already expected. Each
step is defensible. The run ends with a finding nobody needed.

So: you may NOT narrow the claim onto an effect that is small relative to
what the original ask implied, UNLESS the paper can state why that small
effect is ITSELF the answer to the ask — a bound someone needed, a mechanism
that only shows up at that size, a belief it overturns. If you cannot write
that sentence, the move is `widen`, not a sma
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
ller claim.
</narrow_salvage_ban>

<screening_discipline>
Widening multiplies the number of claims in play, and a population of
candidates screened on one body of evidence will always contain one that
looks good by chance. So a widen is only honest with the discipline attached:

- Report `candidates_considered` — how many alternative claims you actually
  weighed this revision, not how many you could imagine. 1 means you weighed
  none, and after a weak or null result with budget left, 1 is a failure to
  do the move.
- A candidate is SCREENED on one body of evidence and CONFIRMED on another
  that the screen never touched — a held-out split, a later period, a
  different population, corpus, site, cohort or case set. Say in the revised
  hypothesis which evidence is which.
- The winner of a screen is a CANDIDATE, never yet a finding. Do not write a
  screening result as the answer, and do not report the best of several
  screened effects as though it had been the only one tested.
- Never re-screen on the confirmation evidence after seeing it. If the
  confirmation fails, that candidate is dead; go back to the population, do
  not go hunting for a subgroup where it survives.
</screening_discipline>

COVERAGE. Independently of the move, answer: does the hypothesis you are
about to write still answer the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK? Set `coverage` to
"full" (it answers the ask), "partial" (it answers a recognisable piece of
it) or "lost" (the run has drifted onto a different question), and write one
sentence in `coverage_statement` saying which part of the ask the next
iteration will answer. "lost" is not a failure to hide — it is the signal
that the next iteration must go back to the ask.
</evidence_state_and_move>

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Work the procedure above in order, then write the revision:

1. Classify the evidence. Set `evidence_state`, judging from what the artifacts ACTUALLY
   produced — an executed number, not a projected, assumed or placeholder one.
2. Read the move off the rule. Set `move` and `move_rationale` (≤200 chars). The rule is not
   advisory: "weak_or_null" with an iteration remaining means `widen`, and "declare" is
   available only on the final iteration or with no budget left.
3. If the move is `widen`, do the widen properly — go back to the user's ORIGINAL ask,
   enumerate a population of candidate answers, propose a cheap screen over all of them and a
   held-out confirmation for the survivor, and set `candidates_considered` to how many you
   actually weighed. The revised hypothesis is the best surviving candidate, or an explicit
   screening hypothesis naming the population and the selection rule.
4. If the move is `fix`, keep the claim word-for-word and name the defect in `move_rationale`.
5. Set `coverage` and `coverage_statement` against the user's ORIGINAL ask, not against the
   hypothesis you are revising.
6. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly — but a critique never
   overrides the move rule; a reviewer asking for a smaller, safer claim after a null result
   is asking for the narrow-salvage this procedure forbids.

Write the revision as a hypothesis the next iteration can act on: `title`, `hypothesis`,
`key_changes`, and `confidence_delta` ("increased", "decreased" or "unchanged").

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — bookkeeping only, and NOT the steering decision (`move` is).
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification
</pasted_content id="43a0">


<pasted_content id="43a0">
 (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the steering fields and the H↔H relation
fields) AND the full list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

# Mechanistic interpretability — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: the FIELD of mechanistic interpretability — what a mechanistic claim is, how it is
validated, and where the frontier sits mid-2026. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions.
This is the SOLE interpretability handbook: SAE-era decomposition
primitives are covered here as one thread of six rather than in a separate deep-dive.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- The field defines itself by **goal, not method**: understand computational mechanisms "in order
  to accomplish concrete scientific and engineering goals" [S1].
- Its own venue prints a **two-track evidence bar**: either "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and
  how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or "clear practical benefits over
  well-implemented baselines" [S14].
- One methodological critique reframes findings as **statistical estimates, not properties**: the
  causal effect of a component is "a volatile random variable rather than a fixed property" [S4].
- **Structure is not mechanism.** Discovery algorithms "sample from an equivalence class of valid
  subgraphs rather than recovering a unique mechanism" [S23].
- **Causal abstraction is vacuous without an encoding assumption**: with unrestricted alignment maps,
  "any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm" [S5].
- The artifact a reader gets is a **hypothesis about the model, not a description of it** —
  attribution graphs (Anthropic) run on a replacement model and give satisfying insight on about
  "a quarter of the prompts" [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Validity & stability of the method itself** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- Circuit discovery is unstable under small perturbations: "small perturbations in input data
  or hyperparameters yield vastly different circuits" [S4] (2025-10, rev 2026-05).
- Phantom specialization: across 75 circuits in five Pythia models, structural differences showed
  "apparent specialization but do not correspond to functional differences" [S23] (2026-06).
- The workhorse approximation was diagnosed — attribution patching's "dominant error stems from the
  non-linearities in the downstream network rather than local curvature at the patched component",
  with a correction in the same paper [S19] (2026-06).

**Intrinsic interpretability (train-for-interpretability)**

- Weight-sparse transformers yield understandable circuits, but "making weights sparser trades off
  capability for interpretability", and "scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero
  parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge" [S18] (2025-11).
- The newest entrant flips the unit from behavior to parameter, asking "whether a single weight can
  be understood globally across the full training distribution" [S2] (2026-07, four models only).

**Evaluation & standardization**

- MIB is a standardized method-comparison benchmark: on causal variable localization "the supervised DAS method
  performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons" [S10] (ICML 2025), extended to a
  community shared task whose framing admission stands — "measuring progress in MI remains
  challenging" [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).
- Randomized baselines invalidate the auto-interp proxy: SAEs on randomly initialized transformers
  score similarly to trained ones [S9] (2025-01, rev 2026-01).

**Decomposition primitives (the SAE era, and after)**

- The sparsity objective is itself a distorting inductive bias: feature absorption "is caused by
  optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy", so
  "SAE latents may be inherently unreliable classifiers" [S30] (NeurIPS 2025 Oral).
- The single latent is not a canonical unit — SAE stitching shows dictionaries are incomplete and
  meta-SAEs show they are "not atomic" [S33] (ICLR 2025); seed-unstable latents concentrate in
  "reproducible lower-rank subspaces", i.e. basis ambiguity rather than noise [S35] (2026-06).
- The raw-latent verdict a reviewer will cite: on steering "prompting outperforms all existing
  methods" and on detection difference-in-means wins — "SAEs are not competitive" [S31] (2025-01);
  contested, but only by an unreviewed supervised-pipeline rebuttal [S25].
- Proxy metrics are the field's own named weak point: "gains on proxy metrics do not reliably
  translate to better practical performance" [S32] (ICML 2025).
- Model diffing has a known-bad default: the crosscoder L1 loss "can misattribute concepts as unique
  to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models"; the same paper ships the BatchTopK
  fix [S34] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The flagship open fleet has already moved past SAE-only — Gemma Scope 2 ships "transcoders,
  cross-layer transcoders, and crosscoders" alongside SAEs [S36] (2025-12).

**Reasoning-trace interpretability**

- Faithfulness and monitorability come apart: "models can appear faithful yet remain hard to
  monitor when they leave out key factors" [S12] (2025-10).
- The dominant unfaithfulness metric is contested — it "confuses unfaithfulness with
  incompleteness", and "the absence of hint words alone does not prove unfaithfulness" [S13]
  (2025-12, rev 2026-05).

**Applied / safety-facing interpretability**

- Persona vectors (Anthropic) predict and pre-empt training-induced trait shifts, and "flag training data that
  will produce undesirable personality changes" [S16] (2025-07) — the clearest applied win.
- A blinded audit protocol exists: three of four teams "successfully uncovered the model's hidden
  objective", SAEs among the techniques used [S17] (2025-03).
- Counter-current, and the sharpest 2026 negative result — internal decodability far exceeded output
  behaviour: "Linear probes discriminated hazardous from benign cases with 98.2% AUROC, yet the
  model's output sensitivity was only 45.1%, a 53-percentage-point knowledge-action gap." SAE
  feature steering "produced zero effect despite 3,695 significant features", and steering was
  "indistinguishable from random perturbation" [S3] (2026-03; 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes,
  one clinical domain).

**Field strategy & meta-science**

- A frontier lab publicly narrowed its bet — "We have been disappointed by the amount of progress
  made by ambitious mech interp work, from both us and others", and "We made a decision to
  deprioritise SAE research as a result, not because we thought the technique was useless" [S6]
  (2025-12). One team's decision, not a field verdict.
- Results are not yet comparable across papers: two studies reached "conflicting conclusions for the
  same behavior", a third found both "partially correct but incomparable" [S8] (2026-04).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- The field's own review concedes "there are many open problems in the field that require solutions
  before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized" [S1] (2025-01), and the LRM sub-map
  names the same gaps [S24]. The two framings a reviewer will invoke: "the returns from
  interpretability have been roughly nonexistent" [S7] (2025-05), against "We are thus in a race
  between interpretability and model intelligence." [S15] (2025-04) — a stated goal, not a result.
- Durable: activation patching remains the gold-standard causal metric faster methods approximate [S19];
  attribution graphs remain the scaling story, with their stated ceiling [S11].

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Circuit-discovery methods and their corrections.** Attribution patching, its error diagnosis and
  second-order fix [S19], structural-vs-functional decoupling [S23], and an eight-method community
  bake-off [S22] are all published.
- **Auto-interp / agentic feature explanation.** Both the agentic pipeline [S21] and the
  randomized-baseline invalidation of its metrics [S9] already exist.
- **Activation steering and its reliability diagnostics.** Per-sample unreliability and the
  linear-approximation limit are characterized [S20]; the AxBench verdict
  already has a published rebuttal [S25].
- **CoT faithfulness / monitorability metrics.** The measurement wave [S12] and the
  metric-invalidating counter-wave [S13] have both landed.
- **Benchmarking MI methods against each other.** MIB [S10] plus its shared-task extension [S22]
  own this; a new leaderboard re-treads it.
- **Developmental / training-dynamics interpretability.** Feature evolution is already tracked
  across pre-training snapshots with crosscoders [S28] (ICLR 2026).
- **Training-data attribution as an interpretability method.** Already explicitly bridged to MI and
  causally validated on Pythia [S26].
- **Multimodal / vision-language mechanistic interpretability.** Has its own survey and taxonomy
  since 2025-02 [S27].
- **Mechanistic interpretability of RL-trained reasoning models.** Occupied through 2026 — temporal
  sparse autoencoders already track feature dynamics across RLVR training [S29].
- **Sparse-dictionary decomposition of activations.** The most-worked lane in the field: SAE features
  are "not better than neurons" on MIB [S10], the auto-interp metrics used to defend them fail a
  randomized baseline [S9], absorption is traced to the objective itself [S30], canonical-unit claims
  are refuted [S33], and the raw-latent steering/detection verdict plus its rebuttal are both
  published [S31] [S25].

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. If exact single-input causal scores are volatile random variables [S4] and structurally distinct
   circuits implement one computation [S23], **what object is circuit discovery actually estimating,
   and at what granularity is a "mechanism" even well-defined?** The field's standard output — one
   circuit, one figure — presupposes an answer it has not given.
2. Causal abstraction is vacuous without a constraint on how models encode information [S5]. What
   would make such an encoding assumption testable independently of the claim it licenses?
3. Near-perfect internal decodability coexists with a large knowledge-action gap and steering
   indistinguishable from random perturbation [S3]. What would have to hold for "we understand it"
   to imply "we can change it" — and is that implication load-bearing for the field's stated
   goals [S1]?
4. Two verdicts clash: the returns are "roughly nonexistent" [S7], yet the same window produced
   deployed applied results [S16] [S17]. On what measure are both true, and which should a paper
   report?
5. Two studies reached conflicting conclusions on one behavior and a third found both partially
   right but incomparable [S8]. What makes two mechanistic findings comparable at all, and can that
   be settled without a standard the field does not yet have?
6. Interpretability is bought at a stated capability cost with a scaling ceiling [S18], while
   auto-interp scores fail to separate trained from random networks [S9]. What is the exchange rate
   between understandability and capability, and who should be willing to pay it?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship a new circuit/feature method that improves a proxy metric on one task. | The rewarded move meets the venue's own bar: state "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or show "clear practical benefits over well-implemented baselines". Recognition signal: a NeurIPS 2025 **Spotlight** went to a result proving the field's own framework vacuous when generalized [S5]. | problematizes-nothing — proxy-metric progress reads incremental in 2026 | L·A | [S14] [S5] |
| Treat a high auto-interpretability or reconstruction score as evidence that real features were recovered. | **Buried (2025-01, rev 2026-01):** the same scores appear on randomly initialized transformers [S9]. Reopening condition, stated there: routine randomized baselines plus targeted measures of feature abstractness. | wrong-result — the metric does not discriminate the thing it is used to claim | L | [S9] |
| Report one circuit, from one extraction, one seed, one input distribution, as *the* mechanism. | **Buried (2025-10 → 2026-06):** effects are volatile random variables [S4]; structure-to-function is many-to-one [S23]. Reopening condition: edge-level evaluation plus cross-condition transfer tests. | wrong-result — a single-draw circuit is an unreported sample from an equivalence class | L | [S4] [S23] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** unusually, it prints BOTH bars in one
> sentence [S14] — a falsifiable mechanistic claim, or a demonstrated practical benefit over strong
> baselines. What clears neither is a method with a better proxy score and no falsifiable
> hypothesis attached [S9] [S22].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Report a circuit from one seed/hyperparameter/input set. | Designing the run: sample across seeds, hyperparameters and input distributions; report the distribution and stability metrics, not the modal circuit. | wrong-result — single-config circuits are unstable | L | [S4] |
| Read structural difference between two circuits as two mechanisms. | Before claiming distinct mechanisms: run edge-level evaluation and cross-condition transfer; source-level evaluation inflates apparent faithfulness. | wrong-result — phantom specialization | L | [S23] |
| Use attribution patching scores as ground truth at scale. | When approximating: screen with a reliability score and correct the leading term; expect downstream non-linearity, not local curvature, to dominate the error. | wrong-result — the evidence for the circuit is itself misspecified | L | [S19] |
| Validate an interpretation with a freely-parameterized alignment map. | Stating the claim: fix and declare the map class, and make the encoding assumption explicit — unconstrained maps hit 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on randomly initialized models. | wrong-result — a perfect fit that means nothing | L | [S5] |
| Use a raw SAE latent as a classifier or steering target. | Choosing the unit: benchmark against difference-in-means and a prompting ceiling before claiming a latent works; expect absorption to make single latents unreliable where features are hierarchical. | wrong-result — the raw-latent verdict is the field's default prior | L | [S31] [S30] |
| Read a crosscoder model-diff at face value. | Diffing two models: use BatchTopK rather than L1 and presence-test any "unique to the fine-tune" latent — the artifact is a property of the loss. | wrong-result — the loss fabricates unique-to-finetune latents | L | [S34] |
| Score SAE/dictionary features against nothing. | Choosing the comparison: benchmark against non-featurized hidden vectors (neurons) and supervised DAS on MIB's tracks. | wrong-result — featurization may add zero | L | [S10] |
| Report auto-interp scores as the validity evidence. | Reporting: add a randomized-transformer arm; treat aggregate auto-interp as a proxy, never as recovery evidence. | wrong-result — untrained networks pass | L | [S9] |
| Claim a steering result from a mean effect at one coefficient. | Reporting steering: give the per-sample distribution and the behaviors where it fails; effect sizes "vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors". | wrong-result — the mean hides the failure regime | L | [S20] |
| Call a CoT unfaithful because it omits a hint that changed the answer. | Judging traces: separate unfaithfulness from incompleteness, and pair hint-based metrics with causal mediation. | wrong-result — the metric over-reports | L | [S13] [S12] |
| Claim interpretability *enables* correction because the information is decodable. | Closing the loop: measure output-level correction AND collateral disruption of already-correct cases, against a random-perturbation control. | wrong-result — decodability ≠ actionability | L | [S3] |

## Decision guide

- **Which primitive for which question:** components and their interactions → circuit localization
  (attribution / mask optimization lead on MIB); an interpretable variable inside a hidden vector →
  causal variable localization (supervised DAS leads; SAE features do not beat neurons) [S10].
- **Post-hoc vs trained-for-interpretability:** post-hoc buys you the deployed model; weight-sparse
  training buys understandability at a capability cost and stops scaling in the tens of millions of
  nonzero parameters [S18].
- **Auditing claims:** in the reference blinded protocol, three of four teams succeeded, leaning on
  several technique families together rather than interpretability alone [S17].
- **Weighing sources:** most 2026 frontier results here are unreviewed preprints; the peer-reviewed
  anchors are [S5] (NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight), [S10] (ICML 2025), [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Activation patching = the gold-standard causal metric; attribution patching = its first-order,
  gradient-based approximation, adopted for cost [S19].
- A "circuit" is a subgraph claimed to explain a behavior on a sub-distribution; the contrasting
  framing asks instead whether a single weight can be understood globally [S2].
- Attribution graphs are computed on a replacement model that "incompletely and imperfectly
  captures the original", so they yield hypotheses, not conclusions [S11].
- Interchange-intervention accuracy is a fit statistic, meaningful only relative to a declared map
  class [S5].
- Monitorability ≠ faithfulness: a trace can be faithful and still omit factors a monitor needs [S12].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **The crowded list is still not exhaustive.** Every lane flagged here has now been
  saturation-checked and ALL came back occupied (all are listed above). No flagged lane remains open.
  **Treat any lane this map does not mention as unchecked, not open, and search before committing —
  the measured base rate for unchecked lanes in this forge is 11/11 occupied.**
- ⚠️ **The actionability negative result [S3] is one clinical domain, one model family.** It is the
  strongest published statement of the knowledge-action gap, but generalization beyond triage
  vignettes is unverified. Confirm/refute: a replication in a non-clinical task with the same
  four-method comparison.
- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed field-wide SURVEY was fetched** (a 2026 ACM Computing Surveys entry exists
  but was access-gated), and nothing independently confirms other labs made the same call as [S6].
  Individual claims are well-anchored — seven sources here are peer-reviewed — but a field-wide
  "the field holds X" statement still lacks a survey to rest on.

You are verifying concrete facts from an already-completed research iteration. READ ONLY — do not modify anything. All paths below are read-only.

Roots:
A = /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1   (Lane A)
B = /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_2   (Lane B, lesion)
C = /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_3   (Lane C, cross-family panel)
D = /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1      (dataset)

Use bash (ls, find, cat, head, python3 -c with json) to answer these SPECIFIC questions. Prefer `python3 -c` with json.load for big JSONs; never dump whole files.

1. LANE C PANEL COMPOSITION. List every checkpoint id in the Lane C panel (look for panel table / per_ckpt dir / method_out.json). State explicitly: does the panel include ANY abliterated / uncensored / "-abliterated" checkpoint? Does it include mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated? How many checkpoints per family?
2. LANE C NUMBERS. Report exact values for: baseline B3 and B4 ranking accuracy on both targets; candidate K1 on both targets; the per-checkpoint instrument value `cos_rcontent_rrequest` (min, max, mean, and the value for Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL). Also report the judged refusal rate and harmful_compliance_rate for Qwen3-4B-SafeRL if present, and the min/max/std of each behavioural truth column.
3. LANE C REUSABILITY. Are the harvested activations / per-checkpoint feature files persisted on disk (paths + approximate total size)? Could a new readout be recomputed WITHOUT re-running the harvest? Say yes/no with evidence.
4. LANE B DEPTH + LESION. Report the depth-profile numbers: projection gap along u at the shallow layer vs the fitted layer (intact), post-lesion values, and the held-out probe AUROC per alpha. Confirm whether `causal_arm` in results.json is empty and quote the crash errors from the logs directory. Also report the per-layer Cohen's d table by checkpoint (best layer + d for each of the 4 checkpoints) and confirm whether mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated appears in that table.
5. LANE A GATES. Report K3's entry in s1_table (margins, ci95, ci_excludes_zero), the shuffled-label band values for A and T, the split-half cosine per checkpoint (G1), G5 placebo verdict, and the achieved r / MDE numbers.
6. DATASET REGISTRY. In D, open model_registry.json (or equivalent) and report how many repos are listed, how many are ungated, and list every entry that is an ABLITERATED / uncensored / "uncensored" variant, with its declared parent if present. Also list which families have BOTH an instruct arm and an abliterated arm available ungated.

OUTPUT FORMAT: a compact markdown report, one numbered section per question, exact numbers only, with the file path each number came from. If something does not exist, say "NOT FOUND" with the paths you checked. No narration, no logs, no speculation.
