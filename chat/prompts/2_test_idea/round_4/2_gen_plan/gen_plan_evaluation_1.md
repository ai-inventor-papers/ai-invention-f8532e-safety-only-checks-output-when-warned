<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EVALUATION

EVALUATION
Evaluate experiment results with metrics, statistical analysis, and validity checks.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any evaluation library), isolated workspace, gradual scaling matching experiment.
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Compute any quantitative metrics and statistical tests, analyze validity and robustness.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one EXPERIMENT | OPTIONAL DATASET if reference data needed
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budget>

The evaluation executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_plan/gen_plan_evaluation_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_plan/gen_plan_evaluation_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_plan/gen_plan_evaluation_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_YqmEFECOIR3D/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_plan/gen_plan_evaluation_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Where the logit gap gets fooled
hypothesis: |-
  THE CLAIM IN ONE SENTENCE. What a single model's activation readout buys over its final-layer refusal-logit gap is not a stronger correlation with graded behaviour but two properties the logit gap lacks by construction. The first is SPECIFICITY: the readout does not move when a checkpoint's output expression changes but its behaviour does not. The second is TWO-SIDEDNESS: the readout carries information about over-refusal as well as harmful compliance. Iteration 4 screens a named population of 13 single-model readouts for these two properties and confirms the survivor on a new, larger panel that the screen never touches.

  MECHANISM, and why the direction is predicted rather than hoped for. BL1 reads refusal where it is EXPRESSED: the logit gap between refusal and compliance tokens at the last prompt position. Anything that changes expression without changing the harmful-content policy moves BL1. That includes a chat template, the refusal lexicon, a re-download, a DPO pass on a non-safety objective, or any edit to the unembedding's refusal rows. A request-axis separability read on the mid-depth residual stream sits upstream of expression, so it should be invariant to expression-only changes and should move only when the representation moves. The same mechanism makes BL1 ONE-SIDED. A refusal-logit gap is monotone in refusal propensity, so it cannot tell a safe model from a blanket refuser, and it cannot credit a safe-completion model like Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (safety up while refusal falls 12.9 to 5.3). An internal profile with a separate benign-side term can do both. The ask has two failure directions and a cheap metric that sees only one is not a safety evaluation.

  WHAT ITERATION 3 ACTUALLY PRODUCED (executed numbers only).
  (1) HELD-OUT PANEL, n=10 never-loaded checkpoints, graded BEFORE any internal readout was computed. Families: llama3.2, falcon3, amd-olmo and lfm2 (NOT Qwen3/SmolLM3/Phi/Granite, which the draft paper wrongly states). Checkpoints: Vikhr-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct plus its abliterated child, unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct plus mylesgoose abliterated2, Falcon3-1B Base and Instruct, AMD-OLMo-1B base / SFT / SFT-DPO, and LFM2-700M. The TIME rule dropped danube3-500m-chat and LFM2-1.2B. The permutation critical |rho| is 0.648 and the 80%-power MDE is 0.797. Spearman rho with harmful compliance: F_clust (mislabelled B3) -0.89 [-0.95,-0.57]; C13_peak_d -0.66; C5 and C7 -0.62; BL1 -0.62. |rho|-|rho_BL1| for F_clust is +0.27 with a paired CI of [-0.24,+0.70]. NO row beats BL1 with a paired CI excluding zero. The screen-to-held-out join was DEFERRED (no survivor file existed), so that table is descriptive, not confirmatory.
  (2) REPRODUCIBLE WRONG-SIGNED ROWS. Held-out / iteration-2 panel: C2 site gap +0.66/+0.66, C2_tpr5 +0.77/+0.68, C6 +0.69/+0.42, C9 +0.64/+0.65. 28 of 30 rows keep their sign across the two panels. The response-vs-prompt site quantities predict harmful compliance reliably, but in the direction opposite to the one registered.
  (3) B7 ARTEFACT. The weights-only scar reaches rho +0.80 only because OLMo's mean-subtracting LayerNorm forces an all-ones null direction. Projecting that direction out gives +0.08. Lesson: weights-only null-direction statistics must project out architecture-mandated nulls.
  (4) THE SPECIFICITY DISSOCIATION, the one positive, replicated activation-vs-logit result the run has. Held-out request-axis d at l_star falls in 8/8 behaviourally effective abliterated pairs: 6 iteration-2 pairs with CIs below zero, Vikhr -0.90 [-1.38,-0.55] with dHC +0.60, and Llama-3.2 -0.61 [-0.88,-0.36] with dHC +0.22. The commissioned mlabonne child drops 2.45 to 0.71, delta -1.73 [-2.35,-1.19]. On both behavioural no-ops d does NOT move: the Granite re-download (+0.09, CI covers 0) and AMD SFT to SFT-DPO (dHC -0.022; peak d +0.058 [-0.075,+0.159]; C7 -0.010). BL1 moves sharply on both: Granite -4.82 and AMD +1.61 [+0.98,+2.29]. Peak drive moves on Granite (-2.49). Its limit must be stated beside it: AMD base to SFT (dHC +0.56) moves NO activation readout. That is a sensitivity failure on a non-abliteration safety change.
  (5) COLLINEARITY IS THE CAUSE OF THE THREE NULLS. Across 25 checkpoints every activation readout correlates 0.71-0.79 with BL1. Partial rho with HC given BL1 (n=23, the checkpoints with HC): d -0.46, F_clust -0.47, peak drive -0.33, R +0.02. Pooled over 32 checkpoints (context only): F_clust -0.80 [-0.91,-0.72], C7 -0.75, C13_peak_d -0.72, BL1 -0.68. All three are LOFO sign-stable. Every candidate scored so far is a SEPARABILITY LEVEL on the same request axis the logit gap expresses. A fourth screen of more levels would return the same null.
  (6) WITHDRAWALS FROM THE EVALUATION. Accumulation holds only on EASY cross-fitted prompts. On HARD prompts the frozen-axis start gap is negative, so the test is undefined, and the Spearman signs are mixed (+0.31/-0.51/-0.54/+0.63/+0.15). The response-site "execution" reading is WITHDRAWN: non-safety L4 drops -0.169 at the LATE site against L2 -0.185 / L3 -0.138 / L1 -0.083, and no safety-minus-control CI excludes 0. The Lane B lineages are L1=Qwen3-4B-Base, L2=instruct, L3=SafeRL, L4=STaR, with r_ablit fitted at layers 29/22/23/29, outside the 13-21 lesion band. L1 is a Base control, not a safety lineage.
  (7) THE WIDENED CLAIM IS CLOSED AS PRIOR ART. AMS (arXiv:2608.05578, Apache-2.0, `pip install ams-scanner`) is reference-free, uses 16 pairs, reads the final prompt token at 40-80% depth, and scores 14 checkpoints including 2 abliterated. It reports Pearson -0.546 (p=.043), a non-significant Spearman of -0.423, and LOO threshold accuracy of 71%. It has NO logit baseline, NO over-refusal outcome, NO no-op controls and NO response site, and it names decode-time analysis as its principal open problem.

  WHY THIS IS WEAK_OR_NULL AND WHY THE WIDEN CHANGES THE CRITERION, NOT THE SCALAR. Three screens (5, 14 and 30 rows) never showed an activation readout beating BL1 on correlation with graded harmful compliance. At n=10 the design could not have detected a partial rho below 0.80. The widen does NOT shrink the claim onto result (4). Result (4) is 8+2 pairs, and one sensitivity failure sits beside it. Instead the widen goes back to the ask: "run this metric on any HF model instead of the full benchmark". A drop-in replacement for a benchmark fails in two ways the correlation criterion never scored. It can raise false alarms on checkpoints whose behaviour did not change, and it can be blind to over-refusal. Those are the criteria the new population is screened on. The criteria are fixed before scoring, and the correlation margin over BL1 and AMS is kept as a co-criterion, not dropped.

  THE CANDIDATE POPULATION (13). Every candidate reads the activations or weights of ONE model on at most 32 prompts, and none needs a parent at scoring time.
   N1  d_lstar: held-out request-axis Cohen's d at the model's own best layer (EASY-fit, HARD-scored). This is the current specificity leader and is carried in as a candidate, not a winner.
   N2  d_lstar computed in the subspace ORTHOGONAL to the unembedding-realised refusal direction (the top-k refusal-token rows of W_U projected out). This makes it BL1-residual by construction, so any predictive power left over is information BL1 does not carry.
   N3  F_clust: the Fisher cluster-separation ratio (mu1-mu0)^2/(var1+var0) of the 1-D projection, in the same orthogonal subspace. This is the statistic the draft called "direction self-consistency".
   N4  depth-profile SHAPE vector (onset fraction, peak fraction, width at half-max) instead of a scalar, scored by LOFO ridge.
   N5  INVARIANCE score: within-model drift of N1 under expression-only perturbations of the SAME checkpoint (chat template on/off, system-prompt swap, bf16 vs fp16 or int8 load). It needs no parent and asks directly whether a readout is expression-driven.
   N6  benign-side separability: XSTest safe twins vs matched harmful, read as a predictor of OVER-REFUSAL.
   N7  signed two-sided gap: harmful-side minus benign-side separability, the internal analogue of the safe-engagement rate.
   N8  severity monotonicity: within-model Spearman of the readout against PKU-SafeRLHF ordinal severity 0-3.
   N9  DECODE-SITE readout: the same axis read at the model's OWN first 1-8 generated tokens under greedy decoding, not teacher-forced. This is AMS's stated open problem.
   N10 the prompt-minus-decode site gap, following the REPRODUCED sign of C2. It is registered with the observed sign (+) and must hold on new checkpoints. This is a prediction, not a rescue.
   N11 layer-matched Fisher separation on the request axis restricted to the AMS depth window (40-80%), which tests whether AMS's own window is the operative choice.
   N12 a pre-registered two-feature combination: the best of N1-N3 plus the best of N6-N7, with weights fixed by LOFO inside the screen.
   N13 THE POWER ALTERNATIVE, weighed as a competing claim: that nothing beats BL1 only because n was 10. It is tested by the confirmation panel's size, not by a new readout.
  Incumbent BARS, not candidates: BL1_easy, BL1_hard and BL1_truelogit (labelled separately everywhere; the draft mixed them and the mlabonne signs are opposite, -1.96 vs +1.76); AMS sigma run from its released code; C7; C13_peak_d; B7 with architecture nulls projected out; the card/name regex; greedy refusal rate; and the shuffled-label band run through the whole pipeline including the direction fit.

  SCREEN (one body of evidence, CPU-scorable from disk). The 32 already-graded checkpoints (22 from iteration 2 plus the 10 held-out from iteration 3; activations under harvest/<tag>/). N5 and N9 need one extra prompt-only or short-greedy pass per checkpoint. Outcomes: harmful compliance, over-refusal, and safe-engagement. Once scored, these 32 are SCREEN evidence and can never again serve as confirmation.

  THE NO-OP AND EFFECTIVE-EDIT SET IS BUILT IN-HOUSE SO THE COUNT CANNOT FAIL. Iteration 2 died because harvested strata held 3/2/1 pairs. Iteration 4 constructs at least 8 behavioural NO-OPS: re-save/re-download, dtype and int8 casts, chat-template swap, a short non-safety LoRA, a non-safety DPO step, and a refusal-lexicon-only unembedding perturbation. It also constructs at least 8 EFFECTIVE changes: in-house rank-one lesions at matched strengths across at least 3 families, plus the harvested community children. Each is graded before any readout is computed. A pair counts as a no-op iff |dHC| <= 0.05 and |dOR| <= 0.05 with CIs inside +/-0.10.

  SELECTION RULE, fixed and hashed before scoring. A candidate survives iff ALL of the following hold.
  (i) FALSE ALARMS (primary): on the no-op set its paired change CI covers zero in at least 7/8 pairs, AND its median |change| in own-checkpoint shuffled-null SD is at least 1.0 below BL1's.
  (ii) SENSITIVITY: its paired change CI excludes zero, in the right direction, on at least 7/8 effective changes, AND it moves on AMD base to SFT, the case that N1 currently misses.
  (iii) TWO-SIDEDNESS: partial rho with over-refusal given BL1 has a CI excluding zero, which BL1 cannot satisfy by construction.
  (iv) RESIDUAL INFORMATION: partial Spearman with harmful compliance given BL1 AND given AMS sigma has a CI excluding zero.
  (v) it escapes the shuffled-label band.
  (vi) it is off ceiling in every arm.
  Ties go to fewer prompts. Every row is printed with its MDE, the full k-curve (k in {0,4,8,16,32}), the expected sign and the observed sign, with no maximum over a scan. If nothing survives, the output is the ranked table plus the false-alarm and two-sidedness columns for every incumbent. That is still the first per-checkpoint false-alarm audit of AMS and BL1, and it is reported as such.

  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION (never seen by the screen; used once; no re-screening). Three parts:
  (a) at least 30 NEW checkpoints from at least 8 families not in the 32, all at or below 4B, graded before any internal score is read. This powers |partial rho| of about 0.45 at 80%, where n=10 needed 0.80.
  (b) the 2 sealed families (StableLM, SmolLM2; truth hash-committed; seal status DISCLOSED_UPSTREAM is stated) and the never-loaded 54-scenario XSTest split.
  (c) a fresh in-house no-op and effective-edit set on those new families.
  The survivor must keep its sign and pass (i), (ii) and (iv) there. If it fails, it is dead.

  CAUSAL CHECK, required of any survivor. At the survivor's own layer and site in Qwen3-4B instruct and SafeRL, run a matched-norm projection of the fitted direction against an orthogonalised random direction, with judged refusal and over-refusal as outcomes. Report per-item distributions and the collateral effect on already-correct benign items (Basu 2603.18353, SAE arm only, for the zero-effect precedent). Without this the survivor is a READOUT, never a mechanism.

  WHAT THE THREE COMMISSIONED MODELS GET REGARDLESS. Every table has a row for Qwen3-4B-Base, instruct, SafeRL, STaR (the non-safety control) and mlabonne-abliterated, with BL1_easy, BL1_hard and AMS sigma beside every activation number. SafeRL is the decisive two-sidedness case. The prediction is that N6/N7 separate it from instruct, where BL1 ranks it BELOW instruct (3.07 vs 4.99) despite higher safety. The abliterated child is the decisive specificity case, set against the Granite and AMD no-ops.

  REVIEWER MUST-FIXES CARRIED AS REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEXT PAPER. (1) The actual held-out repos, roles and HC go in a per-checkpoint appendix, and the exclusion and TIME rules are stated. (2) Distinct symbols d_lstar and F_clust, each defined as coded; "direction self-consistency" is deleted; C3 (|cos| shallow vs deep, +0.62, wrong-signed) is reported if a cross-layer cosine is wanted. (3) The FULL held-out table with the critical value 0.648, the MDE 0.797, the paired |rho|-|rho_BL1| CIs, the wrong-signed rows and the B7 artefact. (4) Accumulation scoped to in-distribution, with the HARD result beside it and the end-to-start ratio in place of peak-to-start; the unsupported "all lineages x doses x sites" sentence is deleted. (5) Corrected lineage table, with L2-L4, L3-L4, L2-L1 and L3-L1 as the safety-minus-control contrasts. (6) The specificity dissociation as a 2x2 table and figure, framed as a replication of Llorente-Saguer 2026a/b where recognition survival is concerned. (7) All 17 deviations disclosed, including items cut to Lane C's 90, the post-prereg LOFO, and the double-normalised BL1, which is harmless for ranking (BL1_truelogit rho 1.00). n=23 for partials. (8) Bibliography: add Orgad2026 and Yamaguchi2025, cite OBLITERATUS for cross-layer cosines, and source or delete the 0.016 figure.

  PRIOR-ART FENCES. MUST NOT claim any of the following: a first cross-family few-prompt activation metric (AMS); a first internal scoring of abliterated checkpoints; reference-free or <=16 prompts as novelty; recognition/execution naming (Orgad 2604.09544, 2603.05773); recognition surviving abliteration (2603.27412, 2604.18901); or any weights-only statistic (Jorak, the 273-checkpoint audit). The claimed empty cell is narrow and checkable. It is a per-checkpoint FALSE-ALARM and OVER-REFUSAL audit of single-model activation readouts against both the logit gap and AMS, with a site-local causal test. None of AMS, N-GLARE, RAS or Aligned Probing reports any of these.
motivation: |-
  1. THE MEASUREMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROPERTY AND AN AVERAGE, AND THAT IS THE PART THAT
  CHANGES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. If A is large, the response-site effect the literature reports is an
  average over a request factor nobody varied. It is then not a per-model property at all but a property
  of the model crossed with the harmful-request setting it was measured in. Two checkpoints with
  identical published response-site effects can behave completely differently the moment the request
  stops looking dangerous -- which is the regime that matters in long generations, multi-turn use and
  agentic tool loops, where the hazardous text a model is continuing was often not requested by anybody.
  This claim is publishable whichever way the checkpoints fall, and it costs 1,280 forward passes to
  settle for a given model.

  2. THE MISRANKING THE METRIC IS MEANT TO FIX IS DOCUMENTED, NOT ASSUMED. Internal harmfulness scores
  read at prompt-dependent locations have been reported to ANTI-rank successful jailbreaks, at AUROC
  0.220 among wrapped harmful prompts, meaning successful attacks rank LOWER than failed ones. That is
  independent published evidence that the standard cheap readout measures the wrong thing. The
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL card is the clean instance: in NON-THINK mode its safety rate rises 64.7 to 98.1 on
  WildGuard while its refusal rate FALLS 12.9 to 5.3, and on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge the same rows
  read 47.5 to 86.5. Both columns are quoted deliberately: 98.1 is near ceiling so the WildGuard column
  overstates headroom, and in THINK mode refusal barely moves, 6.5 to 6.2, so the argument that SafeRL
  cannot buy safety by refusing at token one is scoped to the non-think setting this study runs in.
  Every cheap readout in use -- first-token refusal probability, refusal-direction projection at the last
  prompt token, activation cluster separation, refusal rate -- reads the request-side gate, which is
  exactly the component this kind of training turns down.

  3. THE PRACTICAL ADVICE IS ALREADY PROVEN AND IS NOT CLAIMED; THE MECHANISM IS WHAT IS MISSING. A
  published defence trains on justify-then-refuse responses that distribute the refusal signal across
  token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under abliteration against 70 to 80
  point drops for baselines, with a feature-space section showing the edit shrinking the harmful-versus-
  benign PROMPT centroid distance far less in those models, 10.0 / 7.7 / 13.7 against 28.8 / 33.9 / 28.7.
  So "put safety where a prompt-fitted rank-one edit cannot see" is known, and that paper measures the
  request axis at the prompt in models built to resist. What is missing is a measurement at RESPONSE
  positions that separates the request-gated part from the request-independent part, and a checkpoint
  that was not designed to resist. The claim is that the mechanism is the arming term, and that a model
  trained for something else entirely -- safe completion -- shows the same protective structure with
  nobody having built it in. Those same numbers are also why the surviving-monitor comparison is made at
  matched request-axis damage.
assumptions:
- >-
  The internal safety signal is linearly readable at generated positions and not only at the decision token. This is established
  rather than assumed: streaming hidden-state moderation probes decode the harmfulness of a partially written response throughout
  generation, and arXiv:2607.14147 reads the harm direction at response positions with a causal effect. The readout used here
  is a difference-in-means axis fitted on a DISJOINT corpus of hazardous versus benign continuations at response positions,
  benchmarked against a cross-validated linear probe and against raw hidden vectors, with the cross-fitted variant over the
  evaluation items retained as a robustness row.
- >-
  The response-content harm axis is not collinear with the direction abliteration removes. This is the load-bearing instrument
  assumption and it is measured rather than asserted: r_content is fitted at RESPONSE positions on a continuation contrast
  under a held-fixed request, where the abliteration direction is fitted at the last PROMPT token on a request contrast, and
  |cos| between them is a pre-registered Stage-2 gate at 0.50 backed by a component-preservation diagnostic. If the gate fails,
  the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue and are reported as one, with the arm carried by the per-checkpoint
  refit and the full probe. Two further measurement facts sit in the same assumption. Standard abliteration edits only matrices
  that write to the residual stream, using a direction estimated at prompt positions, which is what makes the headline a structural
  prediction rather than a guess; recipes that fit at response positions or re-train after editing would break it and are
  analysed as a separate stratum, never pooled. And cross-checkpoint terms are only comparable after standardisation, because
  residual-stream norms and LayerNorm gains differ between base, instruct, RL-tuned and weight-edited checkpoints and move
  again under the edit, so every cross-checkpoint quantity is expressed in that checkpoint's own measured null-band per-item
  SD with the raw-scale table published alongside.
- >-
  The request factor and the response factor can be varied independently over the same strings, so the interaction is estimable.
  Four cells share one continuation vocabulary and one token span. The threat is that the off-diagonal cells are incoherent
  continuations while the diagonals are coherent, loading a generic instruction-mismatch signal onto exactly the term the
  headline is stated in. This is neither assumed away nor handled by a constant subtraction: a safety-irrelevant crossed control
  of the same shape estimates the coherence interaction, both crossings are calibrated on the model's own log-probability
  of the prefix given the request, and where the mismatch magnitudes do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty
  and the arming term reported net of the covariate, or as an upper bound if the control's mismatch cannot be raised to the
  treatment's.
- >-
  A response-conditioned safety signal is not the same thing as generic autoregressive conditioning, and the two are separable
  by their dependence on the request and by whether they steer. Generic conditioning should produce a response main effect
  with no request modulation. This is the load-bearing scientific assumption behind treating A rather than CB as the safety
  term, and it is tested by two pre-registered non-safety arms -- Qwen3-4B-Base and a non-safety fine-tune of the same parent
  -- plus the causal requirement that the component be a write-handle and not merely readable.
- >-
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL's safety-up, refusal-down profile reflects a genuine safe-completion policy rather than a fixed hedging
  template that keyword refusal detectors miss. A quantitative template-collapse diagnostic runs before the second supporting
  prediction is interpreted: distinct-3-gram rate of SafeRL non-refusals at least 0.6 times that of Qwen3-4B non-refusals,
  and cross-request response similarity at least 0.15 below within-request similarity, both thresholds fixed before the run.

  OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS. A planner should be able to build Stage 0 and Stage 1 from this block alone.

  CHECKPOINTS, all verified live and ungated on 2026-09-20, all Qwen3, 36 layers, hidden size 2560, one
  tokenizer, so layer, head and token position are directly comparable with no alignment step. Each is
  loaded alone on the 20 GB card.
    Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base                     non-safety arm 1; 8.04 GB, bf16
    Qwen/Qwen3-4B                          refusal-style instruct arm; 8.04 GB, bf16
    Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL                   safe-completion arm; 8.04 GB; its card declares
                                           base_model Qwen/Qwen3-4B, so it is the instruct model's own
                                           CHILD, which is what makes the P1-versus-P2 contrast a
                                           parent-child comparison with the pretraining held fixed
    mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated          the community-edited checkpoint the request named; shipped in
                                           F32 at 16.09 GB, so it is cast to bf16 on load, and that cast
                                           is recorded as a stated deviation from the other arms
    non-safety fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base  non-safety arm 2; ladder below
    + in-house edited grid: 5 strengths x {Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL}
    NOT USED: huihui-ai/Qwen3-4B-abliterated, whose repo is gated 'auto' and whose config cannot be read
    without authentication; mlabonne is the ungated community arm.

  NON-SAFETY FINE-TUNE LADDER, in order, fixed now so the arm cannot be chosen after Base is seen:
    (1) an ungated, non-quantised third-party fine-tune whose parent is DECLARED as Qwen3-4B-Base in the
        repo metadata, not merely implied by its name, and which ships the stock Qwen chat template so
        that token spans match the other arms exactly. Verified live on 2026-09-20 and ordered by those
        two criteria: CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.03.01_1e-6 first, a hint-generation SFT run with
        an explicit base_model tag and the stock 4,116-byte Qwen template; then
        CohenQu/Qwen3-4B-Base_HintGen-STaR.04.00_1e-6_no_think, same family; then
        shjondhale/AzureML-Qwen3-4B-Base-GRPO, a math GRPO run with an explicit base_model tag but a
        custom 1,991-byte template, which costs span comparability and is therefore ranked below the
        first two. HikariLight/Qwen3_4B_Base__COMP_ACI_DAMT_SFT_Merged is live and ungated and carries
        the stock template, but its repo declares no base_model at all, so its parentage rests on its
        name; it is a last resort within this rung and would be reported with that caveat.
    (2) failing all three, an in-house LoRA or short full fine-tune of Qwen3-4B-Base on an ungated
        non-safety instruction set -- hours of GPU time at 4B, and it holds parent, tokenizer and
        template exactly fixed, which the cross-family option does not;
    (3) only failing both, a non-safety fine-tune of another family's parent, and then only under the
        standardized null-SD units.
    Any third-party fine-tune differs from the instruct checkpoint in instruction-following ability and
    in chat template as well as in safety training; that is a stated confound, the arm's chat template is
    reported next to its results, and it is why rung (2) is preferred over rung (3).

  READOUT DIRECTION r_content, stated completely because this is what decides whether Stage 2 measures
  anything: difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATION tokens, taken at RESPONSE
  positions, over a fitting corpus of 64 continuation pairs written under a single held-fixed, neutral
  request, disjoint from the 96 evaluation scenarios. It is therefore a different vector from the
  abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the
  last PROMPT token. A fully disjoint fitting corpus is stronger than cross-fitting over the evaluation
  items, not weaker: it removes in-sample selection entirely rather than rotating it, and the
  cross-fitted variant over the 96 scenarios is retained as a robustness row.

  LAYER BAND: a contiguous band of 25% of the network's layers (9 of 36), expressed as a FRACTION OF
  NETWORK DEPTH so it transfers to any architecture, chosen at Stage 0 as the band maximising the continuation-contrast
  positive control in Qwen3-4B, computed on the FITTING CORPUS ONLY and never on the evaluation
  scenarios, then frozen for all checkpoints. Secondary, pre-registered: a per-checkpoint BEST-BAND
  search, Holm-corrected, against which the safety-specificity gate must also hold.

  RESPONSE-POSITION WINDOWS: continuation tokens 5-20 (EARLY, primary) and 40-55 (LATE), both read from
  one forward pass over a continuation of at least 64 tokens, so the position curve costs nothing.

  ITEMS: 96 confirmatory scenarios plus a 54-scenario HELD-OUT REPLICATION set, split at random before
  any activations are collected. The supply was checked rather than assumed: XSTest v2 ships 450 prompts,
  250 safe across 10 types and 200 unsafe contrast across 8 types, and in 6 of those contrast families --
  homonyms, safe targets, safe contexts, definitions, figurative language and historical events -- the
  safe and unsafe rows are genuine minimal-edit twins, 25 each, giving 150 tightly matched pairs. The
  remaining two contrast families, discrimination and privacy, are only topically parallel and are
  excluded. So 96 is a power-driven choice out of 150 available pairs and the leftover 54 become a real
  replication set rather than a subsample; OR-Bench (80,359 / 1,319 / 655 rows across its three configs)
  is available if a domain needs topping up. Two prefix families per scenario, generated mechanically
  from two fixed templates: F1 ANNOUNCED, where the continuation opens by naming what it is about to do,
  and F2 ENACTED, where it simply performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement.

  FORWARD-PASS BUDGET: 96 items x (4 safety cells x 2 families + 4 coherence cells) + 128 fitting-corpus
  passes = 1,280 per model state; 15 model states = 19,200 passes. The 54-item held-out replication runs
  on the five checkpoints only, adding 3,240. Total about 22,400 forward passes of at most 320 tokens
  with zero generated tokens: minutes to low tens of minutes of GPU time, which is why the item count is
  set by power and not by compute.

  REFUSAL DRIVE, the dependent variable of the causal arm and of the CB half of the specificity gate,
  defined here because a gate cannot be evaluated against an undefined outcome. PRIMARY: the teacher-
  forced probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the
  intervened span. It is well defined in Base, needs no decision label, and is the quantity the published
  0.24-versus-0.03 routing-concentration figure speaks to. SECONDARY: the cross-validated full-probe
  decision score, trained on Qwen3-4B and applied unchanged to Base, with that transfer flagged. Both are
  output-side READOUTS of an activation-side INTERVENTION, which is what the commissioned invariant
  permits; the deployed metric itself stays activation-only and never uses them.

  EDIT-STRENGTH GRID: five strengths per lineage, spanning zero to the strength at which O collapses,
  with the primary comparison read off each lineage's own O-damage curve by interpolation.

  STAGE 0 -- INSTRUMENT, ITEMS AND GATES, ALL BEFORE ANY EXPENSIVE WORK.
  Build the 64-pair fitting corpus and fit r_content. Check split-half cosine >= 0.70 in every
  checkpoint; below it, the fitting corpus is enlarged before Stage 1 rather than after effects are seen.
  RUN THE POWER CHECK HERE TOO, not only the direction check: on a 24-item pilot subset, estimate r, the
  ratio of the per-item SD of A to the per-item null SD, and recompute the MDE for every row of the
  criteria table at the planned n. If the achieved r implies an MDE above any registered threshold, the
  scenario count is raised toward the 150 available pairs BEFORE the confirmatory run, and the pilot items
  are excluded from the held-out set. The escape hatch is conditional on this check and on the split-half
  cosine, and the achieved r is reported either way, so a reader can see what the design could and could
  not have detected.
  Choose the layer band on fitting-corpus data only and freeze it as a fraction of network depth. Build 96 twin
  scenarios from XSTest's safe split topped up from OR-Bench, and generate both prefix families
  mechanically from two fixed templates, publishing all cells verbatim. Gates: (a) an external judge
  labels twins and prefixes correctly at a stated rate; (b) a positive control that r_content separates
  hazardous from benign continuations in Qwen3-4B; (c) a PLACEBO prefix factor at the same lexical
  distance, tested for equivalence within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST, whose attainability is shown above;
  (d) null bands from at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the ENTIRE
  pipeline including the direction fit, which is also what defines the null-SD unit; (e) the NLL-MATCH
  DIAGNOSTIC described next.

  THE COHERENCE CONTROL IS CALIBRATED, NOT ASSUMED. Subtracting the coherence interaction from the safety
  interaction is only valid if the generic instruction-mismatch signal enters additively and if the two
  crossings produce mismatches of comparable magnitude -- and a benign request followed by an off-topic
  benign prefix is a mild non-sequitur where a benign request followed by a hazardous prefix is a severe
  one. The calibration costs nothing because it comes from the same forward passes: the model's own mean
  token log-probability of the PREFIX given the REQUEST. The four-cell log-probability table is reported
  for BOTH 2x2s as a mandatory Stage-0 diagnostic, and the off-diagonal penalty in the coherence crossing
  must be statistically indistinguishable from, or larger than, the penalty in the safety crossing before
  any subtraction is performed. If they do not match, nothing constant is subtracted: the per-item
  readout is regressed on the per-item log-probability penalty across all cells and A_net is reported as
  the coefficient net of that covariate, which survives both a magnitude mismatch and mild
  non-additivity. If the coherence penalty cannot be brought up to the safety penalty at all, A_net is
  reported as an UPPER BOUND on arming rather than as an estimate, and labelled that way everywhere.

  STAGE 1 IS THE COMMISSIONED DELIVERABLE: THE ACTIVATION-LEVEL COMPARISON. Five checkpoints, each loaded
  alone on the 20 GB card, with the F32 community checkpoint cast to bf16 on load and that cast recorded
  as a stated deviation. The 54-scenario held-out set is run here too, on these five only, and its
  estimates are sealed until the confirmatory analysis is complete. For every layer and every position in the frozen window, produce maps of O, CB
  and A in all five, with item-clustered bootstrap intervals and per-item distributions rather than means
  alone, in both raw and null-SD units, under BOTH prefix families and BOTH response-position windows. The base
  protocol is stated rather than left to formatting: Base is run twice, once with the Qwen3-4B chat
  template applied verbatim so token spans match across checkpoints and once in plain completion format,
  and the two must agree qualitatively before Base is used as a control, because alignment is reported to
  concentrate in the assistant header tokens and those tokens are out of distribution for Base.
  The RESPONSE-POSITION curve, A in the early window against A in the late window, is reported as a
  result in its own right: it separates an arming term that persists from a shallow-alignment transient
  at one position, which a single frozen window cannot do, and it is free because both windows come from
  the same forward pass.

  THE CAUSAL ARM USES THE RUNG THAT SURVIVES. Not full-residual patching: that restores refusal to 100
  percent at every layer, but so does patching the mean BENIGN residual at the same position, so the
  intervention is generic disruption and a random-direction control cannot detect the failure because the
  benign patch is the treatment. Instead add or remove ONLY the r_content component at response
  positions, at layer cells fixed at Stage 0, against a matched-norm control direction ORTHOGONALIZED to
  it, with full-residual patching retained and labelled as a positive control that the intervention did
  something. Report collateral disruption on already-correct benign cases and the per-item effect
  distribution, never a mean at one coefficient.

  STAGE 2 BUILDS THE MISSING CHECKPOINT AND TESTS THE HEADLINE. No abliterated safe-completion model
  exists, so one pinned rank-one orthogonalisation with the direction estimated at prompt positions is
  applied to BOTH Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-4B-SafeRL across a five-strength grid. Minutes of GPU time, no
  training, recipe held fixed, so a difference between lineages is attributable to safety-training style
  rather than to the tool -- the confound that wrecks comparisons across harvested community checkpoints.
  Stage 2 measures each lineage's O-damage curve first, then makes the primary comparison at the
  pre-registered matched-damage level by interpolation. The annihilation gate and the
  component-preservation diagnostic are evaluated here, before any term is interpreted. The harvested
  public abliteration is an external check that the in-house edit reproduces a real one, and each
  lineage's pre-edit A is recorded before the edit so post-edit survival is a forecast, not a fit.

  STAGE 3 COLLECTS BEHAVIOURAL GROUND TRUTH ON BOTH COLUMNS. For the five checkpoints, the in-house
  edits, and a panel of ungated checkpoints at or below 4B spanning at least SIX families -- families,
  not checkpoints, are the clustering unit -- measure harmful-compliance rate, over-refusal on hard
  benign twins, and safe-engagement rate, graded by a fixed rubric through an OpenRouter judge. Budget
  planned before the sweep at roughly 4,000 to 6,000 graded responses, near 3 to 5 US dollars against the
  10 dollar cap, with the running total checked after every batch and the sweep stopped on approach.

  STAGE 4 ASKS WHETHER THE PROFILE PREDICTS ANYTHING, ON TWO CO-PRIMARY COLUMNS AND AT FIVE PROMPT
  BUDGETS. Leave-one-family-out prediction with no recalibration, of harmful-compliance rate and of
  safe-engagement rate, from (O, CB, A), against baselines prior work says are hard to beat: the
  model-card and repository-name regex, black-box greedy refusal rate, first-token refusal logit gap,
  activation cluster separation, raw hidden vectors as the non-featurized control, and -- added because it
  is the only published family competing on the same axis -- a NON-GENERATIVE LATENT SAFETY EVALUATOR from
  the recent line that scores safety from a checkpoint's latent representations without sampling any text.
  Where such a method has a usable implementation it is run on the same panel; where it does not, its
  reported numbers on any overlapping checkpoints are tabulated beside ours and the comparison is labelled
  indirect. Those methods read the request side and return a scalar, so the claim here is specifically
  that a profile separating the request term from the unconditional response term and their interaction
  beats a scalar on the safe-engagement column, which is exactly where a request-side scalar should fail.
  The decision rule
  is fixed so a coin cannot pass it: the profile must beat the STRONGEST baseline on at least 5 of 6
  families, which a fair coin passes 10.9 percent of the time where a bare majority of six passes 34
  percent, AND the paired family-clustered interval must exclude zero. The same evaluation is repeated at
  k = 4, 8, 16, 32 and 96 quadruples and the smallest k that still passes is reported as the headline
  prompt budget. Both outcomes are informative: if the profile fails to transfer, Stages 1 and 2 stand as
  a mechanism result on the commissioned trio and the failure localises which term refuses to generalise.

  RELEASED ARTEFACTS, because the coordinate is only reusable if the stimuli are: all 768 safety cells
  (96 scenarios x 4 cells x 2 families), all 384 coherence cells, the 128-text fitting battery, the
  fitted directions, the per-item four-cell scalars and the full layer-by-position maps for every
  checkpoint. The nearest existing artefact collects answer-position activations for the same trio but is
  gated, has no counterfactual factor and carries no analysis, so an ungated crossed one is an
  independent contribution.

  FEASIBILITY, VERIFIED THIS SESSION. NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20 GB VRAM, 48 cores, 251 GB RAM; the Qwen3-4B
  checkpoints ungated and downloadable. Stage 1 is 19,200 hooked forward passes with zero generated
  tokens, minutes to low tens of minutes; Stage 2 is a rank-one weight edit. The binding costs are panel
  downloads, streamed one checkpoint at a time, and the Stage 3 judge calls, budgeted above.
success_criteria: |-
  CRITERIA TABLE. Every threshold is a NUMBER, in null-SD units, fixed now. Planning arithmetic, shown
  once and used for every row: the null-SD unit is the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast
  computed under >=20 random unit directions in that checkpoint, so it is n-independent and carries that
  checkpoint's own residual-stream scale. The standard error of a standardized term is r/sqrt(n) where
  r = (per-item SD of the real term)/(per-item null SD); we plan at r = 1.2 and n = 96 scenarios, giving
  SE = 0.123, and report the achieved r. Derived MDEs at n=96: simple term 0.24; two-checkpoint
  difference 0.34; pre/post difference-in-differences 0.48; TOST half-width at 90% 0.20; coherence-net A
  0.25 to 0.34 depending on the covariate R-squared. At n=24 those same numbers are 0.48 / 0.68 / 0.96 /
  0.40, which is why 24 items was abandoned: the difference-in-differences that carries the headline would
  have had a minimum detectable effect of 0.96 null-SD, larger than any margin worth setting. The item
  count is therefore set by this arithmetic and not by what the twin sets happen to yield -- 150 matched
  XSTest pairs exist, 96 are used for the confirmatory analysis and the remaining 54 become a held-out
  replication set whose own two-checkpoint MDE is 0.45.

  CONFIRMS the hypothesis. Every threshold is the NUMBER in the criteria table; nulls are measured from
  at least 20 random-direction and 20 shuffled-label draws run through the whole pipeline including the
  direction fit, never from a nominal chance value.
  - SAFETY-SPECIFICITY GATE, which must pass before any term is called safety, registered PER CHECKPOINT
    before the run so no term is chosen after the fact: Qwen3-4B on A, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL on CB. Each must
    exceed BOTH non-safety arms on its registered term by 0.50 null-SD with item-clustered intervals
    excluding zero, in the frozen band AND against each non-safety arm's Holm-corrected BEST band, so a
    null in a non-safety arm that disappears under the best-band search is reported as a band artefact
    rather than as specificity. Because a base model can carry a readable CB from generic autoregressive
    conditioning alone, the CB half additionally requires the CAUSAL arm: moving the r_content component
    at response positions must change the refusal drive in the safety-trained checkpoint and not in Base,
    against the orthogonalized control. A term that is readable but inert does not pass.
  - COHERENCE-NET ARMING: A_net exceeds 0.40 null-SD with an interval excluding zero in the checkpoint
    registered on A. This applies to A wherever A is claimed and nowhere else: SafeRL is predicted to have
    A near zero, so a null A_net there confirms P2 rather than failing this gate, and the two are
    distinguished by which term each checkpoint was registered on before the run.
  - TEMPLATE GENERALITY: the arming ordering holds under BOTH prefix families, announced and enacted. A
    result present only under the announced family is a property of the announcement, not of the content,
    and is reported as such.
  - ORDERING: A(Qwen3-4B) - A(SafeRL) > 0.50 null-SD and CB(SafeRL) - CB(Qwen3-4B) > 0.50 null-SD, paired,
    intervals excluding zero. The refusal-tuned model's output monitoring is armed by the request; the
    safe-completion model's runs unconditionally.
  - HEADLINE, at the matched-damage level and with no denominator anywhere: (i) post-edit A is equivalent
    to the null band within +/-0.40 null-SD by TOST in BOTH lineages; (ii) post-edit CB exceeds 0.40
    null-SD in every lineage where it exceeded it before; (iii) the difference in differences on
    T = CB + A, the published response-site effect under a harmful request,
    [T_post-T_pre](SafeRL) - [T_post-T_pre](Qwen3-4B), exceeds 0.60 null-SD, paired and item-clustered.
    (iii) carries the claim, and it is stated as a CHANGE in T rather than as a level in CB for two
    separate reasons: a post-edit level comparison is entailed by the pre-edit gap plus (ii), and a
    change in CB has a floor in the very lineage P1 predicts to have little CB to lose. T is nonzero in
    both lineages by construction, so it has neither problem. Underneath it, 7b: writing drop_X = X_pre - X_post so that a
    positive drop means the term fell, then within the lineage whose A clears the null band before the
    edit, drop_A exceeds drop_CB by 0.35 null-SD in that checkpoint's own units; and 7c: the CB difference in differences, reported only where CB_pre clears the null band in
    both lineages and declared UNDEFINED otherwise rather than counted as a failure. If no pair of
    strengths gives matched O damage, the criterion fails and is reported unmet rather than relaxed.
  - FORECAST: the lineage with the smaller pre-edit A shows the smaller absolute change in T, with both
    change intervals excluding zero. This is what makes the pre-edit measurement predictive rather than
    descriptive, and it is registered as its own criterion rather than left in prose.
  - CAUSAL: at fixed layer cells, adding or removing the r_content component at response positions moves
    the refusal drive more than a matched-norm orthogonalized control, with the per-item distribution
    reported, and the size of that effect tracks CB across checkpoints.
  - DOUBLE DISSOCIATION, the strongest single form the result can take: safe-completion training raises
    CB and not A; the prompt-fitted weight edit lowers A and not CB, same recipe, both lineages. No single
    scalar of safety strength can produce that pattern, so if both halves hold with intervals excluding
    zero the two terms are separately real.
  - INSTRUMENT INTEGRITY: |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| at most 0.50 and the edited model's variance along
    r_content at least 0.25 times the median variance along 20 matched-norm random directions. If either
    fails, the parent-fixed post-edit numbers are an annihilation residue, are labelled one, and the arm
    is reported only under refit and full-probe readouts.
  - STABILITY AND REPLICATION: every reported term carries its distribution over bootstrap resamples,
    at least three probe-set subsamples and both prefix families, and a term whose sign is not stable
    across those draws is reported as unstable rather than as an effect. Beyond resampling, the two
    ordering criteria and the coherence-net arming criterion are re-run once on the 54-scenario HELD-OUT
    set, which is split off before any activations are collected; the ordering must hold there in sign,
    with the held-out estimate reported whether or not it does.
  - METRIC PAYOFF: under leave-one-family-out with no recalibration, (O, CB, A) beats the strongest
    baseline on at least 5 of 6 families with a paired family-clustered interval excluding zero, on BOTH
    co-primary columns or on safe-engagement with an honest report of the harmful-compliance result either
    way; and the prompt-budget curve names the smallest k in {4, 8, 16, 32, 96} at which that still holds.

  DISCONFIRMS it, stated so the run cannot be rescued afterwards.
  - THE CHEAPEST KILL, checked at Stage 1 before any judge spend: if A is inside the null band in EVERY
    checkpoint, the arming coordinate is empty, output monitoring where it exists is unconditional, and
    the headline is dead. The run then reports a single response-site term, says plainly that
    arXiv:2607.14147 already owns it, and reports the methodological claim as refuted for this family --
    which is itself the answer to the question asked, not a rebranding.
  - If A and CB are BOTH inside the null band everywhere there is no response-site signal in this family
    under this readout, which would contradict published work and is first treated as instrument failure.
  - If A is as large in Base or in the non-safety fine-tune as in the safety-trained checkpoints, A is a
    fact about autoregressive conditioning, not about safety, and the interpretation is withdrawn.
  - If the NLL-match gate fails and the covariate regression still leaves the safety interaction fully
    explained by the mismatch penalty, the headline term is instruction-mismatch and is reported as such.
  - If CB is readable but r_content is not a write-handle in any safety-trained checkpoint, the monitor
    reading is withdrawn: what was measured is a content representation, the correlational maps stand, the
    causal claim does not.
  - If SafeRL's A is at or above Qwen3-4B's, or its CB at or below, the training-objective argument behind
    P2 is wrong. That is a real finding about safe-completion training and is reported as a refutation.
  - If the edit drives CB into the null band as well as A, or if the T difference in differences comes
    back null or reversed at matched damage, the blind-spot argument is wrong: the two terms share a write
    bottleneck and a prompt-estimated rank-one edit reaches both. If it leaves A above the
    null band, the request-axis fitting argument is wrong in the other direction.
  - If the annihilation gate fails -- |cos(r_content, r_ablit)| above 0.50, or the edited model's variance
    along r_content at floor against the random-direction reference -- then the parent-fixed post-edit
    numbers measure a deleted coordinate rather than a model property, and the Stage-2 headline is
    WITHDRAWN under that basis rather than reported. The arm then carries only what the per-checkpoint
    refit and the full probe support, and if those disagree the honest output is that this design cannot
    settle post-edit survival, which is a stated limit rather than a softened claim. Stages 1 and 3 are
    unaffected, because neither depends on the edited checkpoints.
  - If the arming ordering holds under one prefix family and reverses under the other, A is a property of
    that template and is reported as a template effect, not a checkpoint property.
  - If the template-collapse diagnostic fires, P2 is uninterpretable and must be restated about templates
    rather than controllers.
  - REPORTING RULE, stated once. Every pass-or-fail test takes one of four permitted forms: an absolute
    main effect; the same term compared across two checkpoints; a change in one term, or a difference of
    such changes across checkpoints; or, in exactly one place, a difference between the CHANGES in two
    different terms INSIDE one checkpoint (criterion 7b), which is permitted because both changes are
    expressed in that one checkpoint's own null-SD units and no scale travels between models. None is a
    ratio between two different main effects and none is a share. The descriptive arming fraction A/(CB+A) is reported only where CB+A clears the
    null band, is labelled UNDEFINED elsewhere, and never decides anything. No statistic in this design is
    computable only when the hypothesis is true, and each disconfirming outcome names a quantity that is
    well defined in the world where the hypothesis fails. Equivalence claims use two one-sided tests with
    the margins above, whose attainability is shown arithmetically at n=96; the robustness grid carries
    Holm correction; no criterion is set at the minimum count that would pass it.

  arXiv:2607.14147, Kwon, 'Breaking Refusal in the First Half: A Mechanistic Study of the Prefill Jailbreak' (14 Jul 2026)
  -- THE NEAREST PRIOR WORK and the constraint this design is built around. It holds the request harmful, varies the content
  of the model's own response, reads the harm direction at response positions and concludes that refusal is 'a shallow, response-site
  computation'. That pathway is conceded entirely and is not claimed here. Its pre-registered 2x2 is harm x SURFACE trigger
  density (AdvBench-scary/clean x XSTest-safe/Alpaca) run in the plain condition, never crossed with the prefill factor, and
  it contains no benign-twin construction; the nearest thing to the arming term is a 24-prompt specificity control inside
  one intervention arm, a behavioural difference-in-differences of +16.8 points (harmful refusal 3 to 24 percent, benign 0
  to 4 percent) reported as a check that an attention knockout was harm-specific -- behavioural rather than activation-level,
  unmatched rather than twinned, attached to an intervention rather than to a readout. It produces no per-checkpoint summary
  and contains no abliterated, weight-edited, safe-completion or safety-RL checkpoint; its panel is Qwen2.5-0.5B to 7B, SmolLM2-1.7B,
  Phi-3-mini-3.8B and Phi-3-medium-14B with Qwen2.5 base controls. Three of its findings are adopted rather than rediscovered:
  the full-residual patch is dropped because the benign-residual control also returns refusal to 100 percent at every layer;
  the single refusal direction is demoted because the diff-of-means readout ceilings at AUC 0.727 while a full probe reads
  about 0.85, with SmolLM2 a single-direction counterexample; and its base-model result is treated as the central threat,
  including the detail that most supports this design -- the instruct model routes the same signal to refusal tokens about
  8 times more than the base model does, concentration 0.24 against 0.03, which is exactly the readable-but-inert versus write-handle
  distinction the causal gate is built on.

  responses that distribute the refusal signal across token positions and reports refusal dropping at most 10 percent under
  abliteration against 70 to 80 point drops for baselines. It owns the practical recommendation, which is why that recommendation
  is not claimed as new. It is not purely behavioural: its feature-space section runs PCA on final hidden states of harmful
  and benign PROMPTS and reports abliteration shrinking the centroid distance by 28.8, 33.9 and 28.7 points in standard models
  against 10.0, 7.7 and 13.7 in extended-refusal models. That is a REQUEST-axis measurement at the prompt, with no response-position
  readout, no decomposition into request and response terms and no causal intervention -- and it is the direct source of the
  matched-damage requirement in this design, since it shows the edit is globally less effective on such models. The remaining
  contribution here is the mechanism, small arming plus an unconditional monitor, and the prediction that a checkpoint trained
  for safe completion shows the same protective structure although nobody built it in, which a deliberately constructed defence
  cannot demonstrate.

  discriminate hazardous from benign cases at 98.2 percent AUROC while the model itself flags only 65 of 144 hazards, 45 percent,
  a 53-point gap; sparse-autoencoder feature steering produced zero corrections and zero disruptions, identical to its random-feature
  control, and concept-bottleneck steering was indistinguishable from random perturbation. That is why the safety-specificity
  gate here is stated on the CAUSAL arm and never on the readout alone: a readable component is not a write-handle. The scope
  caveat is stated rather than hidden -- one clinical triage domain, 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes, two models -- so
  it motivates the gate without being treated as a universal law.

  It is the strongest statement that a model's own representations can be made to carry the safety signal, and it is also

  positions, at the instruction token and just after it, and never touches activations over generated text. Its split is therefore

  own the read-rank versus write-rank question, also screened and abandoned. They matter because they predict that a rank-one
  edit is an incomplete write-handle, which is why this design pre-registers the parent-fixed basis, publishes cos(r_parent,
  r_child), and adds the component-preservation diagnostic instead of assuming the edited model is measured in the same coordinates
  as its parent.
inspiration: |-
  The framing came from control engineering and the ESTIMAND came from epidemiology, and it is the second
  import that does the work.

  Control engineering supplies the vocabulary: a controller is open-loop when its action is computed once
  from the reference input, closed-loop when it is recomputed from the plant's own measured output. In an
  autoregressive model the plant output is literally the text already emitted, re-read at every step
  through self-attention, so the distinction is available rather than analogical. That framing alone was
  not enough, because the closed-loop pathway turned out to be published. A borrowed frame earns nothing
  if the thing it names has already been measured.

  What rescued it was effect modification, the epidemiologist's discipline about interactions.
  Epidemiology takes as basic that a treatment effect averaged over a modifier is not a property of the
  treatment, and that the interaction is often the scientifically interesting quantity rather than a
  nuisance to control away. Applied here that is an indictment: the published response-site effect is
  measured only under harmful requests, so it is an effect at one level of an unvaried modifier, and
  whether the request MODIFIES it has not been asked. That turns a missing cell into a real quantity --
  is the monitor armed or always on -- and it is the quantity the abliteration argument actually bears
  on, since an edit fitted on the request axis should remove a request-dependent gate and not a
  request-independent monitor. Epidemiology supplied the discipline that came with it too: an interaction
  is only interpretable against a control for whatever else distinguishes the off-diagonal cells, which
  is why the crossed non-safety control is part of the design rather than an afterthought -- and, in this
  revision, why that control is CALIBRATED on the model's own prefix log-probability before anything is
  subtracted, since an interaction control that produces a milder mismatch than the treatment cells
  under-subtracts by exactly the amount that would manufacture the headline.

  Two smaller imports remain. From experimental psychology, the factorial logic that separating two
  confounded causes requires varying each independently over the same materials: reading safety at one
  token position is a one-cell design and the fix is the other three cells. From reliability engineering,
  the observation that a two-barrier system fails as though it had one barrier when a single fault removes
  both, which is what made the fitting-set argument load-bearing rather than a curiosity. This revision
  adds a third, from measurement theory: a quantity is only comparable across instruments if it is
  expressed in units the instrument itself defines, which is why every cross-checkpoint term is now read
  in that checkpoint's own measured null-band scale instead of in raw residual-stream units.

  The negative screening mattered as much. Five mechanisms were built and abandoned in an earlier
  iteration because their core already exists: attention-side versus write-side dissociation, the
  read-rank versus write-rank funnel, mutational robustness of refusal under weight noise, a
  recognition-versus-enforcement two-axis profile, and a common-cause-failure concentration score. A
  sixth was abandoned next -- the bare closed-loop main effect, which arXiv:2607.14147 owns causally --
  and the question was kept by moving to the term that paper's design cannot reach.
terms:
- term: Published response-site effect (T)
  definition: >-
    T = CB + A = s_H,haz - s_H,ben: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text appears in the model's own
    output under a HARMFUL request. It is algebraically a simple difference, it is the quantity existing response-site work
    reports, and it is nonzero in every safety-trained checkpoint by construction. That last property is why the headline
    survival test is stated as a change in T: a change in CB alone would have a floor in the lineage predicted to have little
    CB to lose, and a post-edit level comparison would be entailed by the pre-edit gap.
- term: Arming (A)
  definition: >-
    The interaction term of the 2x2: how much MORE a model's internal safety signal reacts to hazardous text it has already
    written when the request was harmful than when the request was a matched benign twin. Large A means an output monitor
    the request switches on; A near zero means one that is always on. It is the headline quantity because it is the part of
    the response-conditioned signal that a base model's generic autoregressive conditioning does not predict.
- term: Unconditional output monitoring (CB)
  definition: >-
    The response main effect measured under the BENIGN request: how much the internal safety signal moves when hazardous text
    appears in the model's own output although nothing in the request called for it. Never used alone as evidence of safety,
    because a non-safety-tuned model can have a nonzero CB from next-token statistics alone, which is why the CB half of the
    specificity gate requires the causal arm.
- term: Open-loop strength (O)
  definition: >-
    The request main effect: how much the internal safety signal differs between a harmful request and its matched benign
    twin, averaged over both response prefixes. This is the component every standard cheap readout measures, and the component
    a prompt-fitted weight edit is fitted on. It is also the axis along which the two lineages are matched for edit damage
    before any survival comparison is made.
- term: Effect modification
  definition: >-
    The epidemiological name for a situation in which the effect of one factor depends on the level of another. Its methodological
    consequence is imported directly: where modification is present, a main effect averaged over the modifier is not a property
    of the system, so a response-site effect measured only under harmful requests cannot be read as a per-model property.
- term: Response-content harm axis (r_content)
  definition: >-
    The primary readout direction: a difference in means between hazardous and benign CONTINUATIONS taken at RESPONSE token
    positions, under one held-fixed neutral request, on a fitting corpus disjoint from the evaluation items. It is deliberately
    a different vector from the abliteration direction, which is a difference in means over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS
    at the last PROMPT token. Their cosine is a pre-registered gate, because if the two coincided the weight edit would delete
    the measurement coordinate and every post-edit number would be an algebraic residue rather than a fact about safety.
- term: Null-SD unit
  definition: >-
    The unit every cross-checkpoint comparison is reported in: the per-ITEM standard deviation of the same contrast computed
    under at least 20 random unit directions in that same checkpoint. It is independent of the item count and it carries that
    checkpoint's own residual-stream and LayerNorm scale, which raw projections do not, so it is what makes a term measured
    in a base model, an RL-tuned model and a weight-edited model the same quantity.
- term: Refusal drive
  definition: >-
    The dependent variable of the causal arm, and of the CB half of the safety-specificity gate. PRIMARY: the teacher-forced
    probability mass on a fixed refusal-onset token set at the position immediately after the intervened span, which is well
    defined in a base model and needs no decision label. SECONDARY: a cross-validated full-probe decision score trained on
    the instruct model and applied unchanged elsewhere. It is an output-side readout of an activation-side intervention; the
    deployed metric never uses it.
- term: Coherence control, and its calibration
  definition: >-
    A second 2x2 of the same shape over the same items in which a safety-irrelevant attribute is crossed the same way: a benign
    request about topic A or B, crossed with a benign prefix about topic A or B. It estimates the generic instruction-mismatch
    interaction that would otherwise be indistinguishable from arming. Subtracting it is only licensed if its mismatch is
    as severe as the safety crossing's, so the two are calibrated on the model's own mean log-probability of the prefix given
    the request, and where they do not match the readout is regressed on that penalty instead of having a constant subtracted.
- term: Prefix family
  definition: >-
    One of two structurally different templates from which every hazardous continuation is generated. ANNOUNCED opens by naming
    what it is about to do; ENACTED performs the hazardous content in-stream with no meta-announcement. Both are run because
    a result present only under an explicit announcement is a property of the announcement rather than of the content.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A training-free edit that removes a model's ability to refuse. One refusal direction is estimated by difference of means
    over harmful versus harmless REQUESTS at the last prompt token, then orthogonalised out of every weight matrix that writes
    to the residual stream. Everything it is fitted on lives on the request axis, which is the structural basis of the headline
    prediction. Here it is used as a controlled manipulation for localising the signal, in the way a lesion localises a function.
- term: Matched request-axis damage
  definition: >-
    The condition under which two lineages are compared after editing: edit strengths chosen so that each lineage loses an
    equal amount of O, read off its own measured strength-to-damage curve by interpolation. Without it, a lineage on which
    the edit simply bites less would look protected.
- term: Safe completion
  definition: >-
    An alignment style in which a model answers a risky request at a safe level of detail instead of refusing. Qwen3-4B-SafeRL
    is an openly released model of this kind: in non-think mode its card reports safety rising 64.7 to 98.1 on WildGuard and
    47.5 to 86.5 on the stronger Qwen3-235B judge, while refusal falls 12.9 to 5.3; in think mode refusal barely moves, 6.5
    to 6.2.
- term: Safe-engagement rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of harmful requests a model answers without refusing and without emitting harmful content. A co-primary target
    alongside harmful-compliance rate because, unlike refusal rate, it penalises a blanket refuser, and no cheap internal
    safety metric has been validated against it.
- term: Parent-fixed versus refitted direction
  definition: >-
    Two readout conventions, each registered where it is correct. Parent-fixed, the parent's direction applied to the edited
    child, is the only convention under which 'the arming fell more than the monitor' is a statement within one basis, so
    it is primary for the edited arm, and the direction is carried over rather than refitted inside a fold. A per-checkpoint
    refit is what the DEPLOYED metric must use, since an arbitrary HuggingFace model has no parent.
- term: Teacher forcing
  definition: >-
    Running the model over a fixed, pre-written continuation instead of letting it generate. It makes the four cells exactly
    comparable, costs one forward pass each, and removes sampling noise and decoding choices from the measurement.
- term: Benign twin
  definition: >-
    A request lexically and structurally close to a harmful one but carrying no harmful intent, drawn from XSTest's purpose-built
    safe split rather than authored from scratch. Twins are what make the request factor a manipulation of intent rather than
    of vocabulary.
summary: >-
  A response-site safety effect measured only under harmful requests is an average over an unvaried modifier, not a property
  of the model: crossing the request factor with the model's own already-written output splits that effect into an unconditional
  output monitor and a request-gated ARMING term, and the three Qwen3-4B checkpoints differ mainly in which one they have.
  The resulting three-number profile is read from one model's activations with no generation and no judge, and the claim is
  that a prompt-fitted weight edit destroys the arming term and leaves the monitor, so the pre-edit arming measurement forecasts
  how much safety survives the edit.
alternates:
- title: The refusal a model brings before it reads
  hypothesis: >-
    A model's refusal drive decomposes into an input-independent PRIOR, readable from a contentless forward pass with literally
    zero prompts, plus an input-dependent EVIDENCE slope, how far the internals move per unit of actual harmfulness. Published
    safety scores are a fixed monotone mixture of the two, which is why a model that is safer while refusing less is ranked
    backwards, and the two numbers read separately from one checkpoint's internals reproduce the mixture and beat it. Concretely:
    the base model has neither, the refusal-tuned model has a high prior, the safe-completion model has a low prior and a
    high slope, and abliteration drives the prior down while leaving the slope intact.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the arming interaction is swallowed by the coherence calibration -- if the mismatch penalty in the safety crossing
    cannot be matched and A_net survives only as an upper bound -- because then the interesting structure is entirely in the
    request-to-signal mapping and the prior-slope split is the sharpest decomposition of it. It also wins on cost, since the
    prior needs zero prompts, the extreme end of what the request asks for. It would have to be positioned tightly against
    signal-detection and item-response-theory treatments of refusal, which make the same conflation argument behaviourally
    rather than at the activation level.
- title: Measure safety without any harmful text
  hypothesis: >-
    A checkpoint's safety level is predictable from its internals on entirely benign or contentless inputs, with no harmful
    content anywhere in the pipeline, because safety training leaves a systematic footprint on ordinary computation. The claim
    is specific rather than correlational: safety training reserves residual-stream capacity and shifts benign computation
    in a direction that abliteration partially reverses, so the size of that shift, measured against the model's own benign
    baseline, orders the arms and transfers across families.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the matched-quadruple construction proves fragile -- if the Stage-0 twin, prefix or placebo gates fail -- since
    it needs no harmful prompts, no twins and no matched prefixes at all. It also wins on deployability: an instrument that
    never touches harmful content can be run on any checkpoint by anyone, and every existing cheap instrument still needs
    a harmful or jailbreak set even when it skips generation. Its risk is the mirror image of the main hypothesis's, since
    a footprint on benign computation may be a footprint of fine-tuning in general, so it lives or dies on the same non-safety
    fine-tune control.
- title: How long the hazard state survives
  hypothesis: >-
    The safety-relevant difference between the checkpoints is the PERSISTENCE of the internal hazard state. Under a fixed
    teacher-forced continuation identical across models, the hazard readout decays with token position at a rate that is a
    stable per-checkpoint property, and its time constant in tokens -- hence unit-free, and immune to the cross-checkpoint
    scale problem that forces every level comparison into null-SD units -- orders the checkpoints and predicts how well safety
    survives long generations. Predicted short in the refusal-tuned model, which only ever needed the signal at token one,
    long in the safe-completion model, near zero in the base model, short in the abliterated model.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the response-conditioned signal is real as a correlation but dies under harm-subspace patching, leaving decay
    rather than feedback as the mechanism, and it wins outright if the depth curve the main design already collects shows
    A is a transient rather than a plateau. It is also the cheaper instrument, needing one prompt and one fixed continuation
    per model rather than a matched quadruple plus a calibrated coherence control, and a decay constant estimates stably at
    small sample sizes where an interaction does not.
- title: Safety is a profile over harm domains
  hypothesis: >-
    Safety is not one mechanism but a set of harm-domain-specific write pathways with independently set gains, so a checkpoint's
    safety is a PROFILE over domains rather than a scalar, and the per-domain gains are readable from one model's internals
    with a handful of prompts per domain. The prediction that makes it testable on this trio: safety RL optimises an aggregate
    reward and should FLATTEN the profile, while abliteration removes a single direction fitted to one extraction set and
    should thin it unevenly, deepest in the domains that dominated that set, leaving a checkpoint genuinely still safe on
    some domains and not others.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if within-checkpoint variation across harm domains is larger than between-checkpoint variation, which would mean
    the field's single safety number is the wrong object however it is measured, and it would make the deliverable a risk
    profile rather than a score. It needs no counterfactual construction, no matched prefixes and no coherence control, so
    it is robust to the Stage-0 gates failing, and it is the only candidate whose output an open-weight release process could
    act on directly.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Depth-by-site correlation screen becomes one criterion within a specificity and two-sidedness frame.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  EVIDENCE CLASSIFIED weak_or_null. On the n=10 held-out panel no row beats BL1 with a paired CI excluding 0 (F_clust |rho|-|rho_BL1|
  +0.27 [-0.24,+0.70]). The join was deferred, so that table is descriptive. The widened depth-by-site claim is closed as
  prior art by AMS 2608.05578.
- >-
  DIAGNOSED THE CAUSE OF THREE STRAIGHT NULLS. Every candidate was a separability LEVEL on the request axis the logit gap
  expresses (rho 0.71-0.79 with BL1 over 25 checkpoints), so a fourth screen of levels is abandoned.
- >-
  SUCCESS CRITERION CHANGED from correlation margin over BL1 to SPECIFICITY (no false alarm on behavioural no-ops) plus TWO-SIDEDNESS
  (over-refusal information BL1 cannot carry). The correlation margin is kept as a co-criterion against both BL1 and AMS sigma.
- >-
  MECHANISM STATED. BL1 reads refusal where it is expressed, so expression-only changes fool it (Granite -4.82, AMD SFT->DPO
  +1.61 [0.98,2.29] on behavioural no-ops) while mid-depth d does not move (+0.09; +0.058 [-0.075,0.159]).
- >-
  NEW 13-CANDIDATE POPULATION (N1-N13), including a BL1-orthogonalised d and Fisher ratio, a parent-free invariance score
  under expression-only perturbations, benign-side and signed two-sided readouts, a decode-site readout (AMS's open problem),
  and the power alternative as a competing claim.
- >-
  NO-OP AND EFFECTIVE-EDIT SETS CONSTRUCTED IN-HOUSE (at least 8 each) so the stratum-count failure of iteration 2 cannot
  recur.
- >-
  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION RESIZED to at least 30 new checkpoints from at least 8 new families (powers partial rho of about 0.45
  where n=10 needed 0.80), plus the sealed families, the 54-scenario split and a fresh no-op set. The 32 already-scored checkpoints
  are demoted to screen-only.
- >-
  SENSITIVITY FAILURE NAMED rather than hidden. AMD base->SFT (dHC +0.56) moves no activation readout, and any survivor must
  move on it.
- >-
  REPRODUCIBLE WRONG-SIGNED SITE ROWS (C2 +0.66/+0.66, C2_tpr5 +0.77/+0.68, C9 +0.64/+0.65) registered as a signed prediction
  (N10) on new checkpoints, never as a post-hoc flip.
- >-
  ALL REVIEWER MUST-FIXES CARRIED as requirements: true held-out repos and families; d_lstar vs F_clust symbols; full held-out
  table with critical 0.648 and MDE 0.797; accumulation scoped to EASY; lineages L1=Base/L2=instruct/L3=SafeRL/L4=STaR; 17
  deviations disclosed; BL1_easy and BL1_hard labelled; n=23 partials; bib fixes.

  WITHDRAWN: response-site 'execution' reading (L4 -0.169 comparable to safety lineages), 'direction self-consistency', and
  accumulation out of distribution. B7 is reported as an architecture-null artefact (+0.80 -> +0.08).
- >-
  COMMISSIONED TRIO KEPT CENTRAL. SafeRL is the decisive two-sidedness case (BL1 ranks it below instruct, 3.07 vs 4.99) and
  mlabonne the decisive specificity case (d 2.45->0.71).

objective: >-
  Run the pre-registered 13-candidate SPECIFICITY + TWO-SIDEDNESS screen on the 32 already-graded checkpoints, using activations
  saved on disk, and freeze survivor.json (a candidate id or NONE). In the same artifact, emit the corrected tables that close
  every BLOCKING reviewer must-fix, so the next paper is built on re-derived numbers.
approach: |-
  EVIDENCE ON DISK (CPU re-analysis; no new judge spend).
  - Iteration-2 harvest: harvest/<tag>/A_prompt.npy (256 prompts x all layers), A_resp / D_resp_parts, logit-lens drives and weight summaries, under iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1. It covers 22 graded checkpoints.
  - Iteration-3 held-out panel: 10 checkpoints under iter_3/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1/harvest/<tag>/, graded truth in results/graded_truth.json.
  - The corrected Qwen3-4B tables in iter_3/gen_art/gen_art_evaluation_1.
  All 32 are now SCREEN evidence and are labelled that way everywhere. N5 (expression-only invariance) and N9/N10 (decode site) need one extra short pass per checkpoint. If no GPU is available, compute them on the subset where the pass fits in the time budget, print the rest as NOT EVALUATED, and never impute. The in-house no-op / effective-edit set comes from the parallel experiment and is NOT available here. On the 2 existing no-ops plus the 8 existing effective pairs, clause (i)/(ii) is scored PROVISIONALLY and labelled provisional.

  STEP 0. Write prereg.json and hash it with SHA-256 BEFORE the first candidate is computed. It holds the candidate definitions N1-N13 exactly as in the hypothesis, each one's layer/site rule, the expected sign (N10 registered '+'), the outcomes, and the selection rule below, verbatim.

  SELECTION RULE. A candidate survives iff ALL of the following hold:
  (i) FALSE ALARMS: on the no-op set its paired change CI covers 0 in at least 7/8 pairs, AND its median |change| in own-checkpoint shuffled-null SD is at least 1.0 below BL1's.
  (ii) SENSITIVITY: its CI excludes 0 in the right direction on at least 7/8 effective changes, AND it moves on AMD base to SFT.
  (iii) TWO-SIDEDNESS: partial Spearman with over-refusal given BL1 has a CI excluding 0.
  (iv) RESIDUAL INFORMATION: partial Spearman with harmful compliance given BL1 AND AMS sigma has a CI excluding 0.
  (v) it lies outside the shuffled-label band, re-running the whole pipeline including the direction fit.
  (vi) it is off ceiling and floor in every arm.
  Ties go to fewer prompts. No maximum is taken over layer, k or site after looking. Every row ships its MDE, the k-curve for k in {0,4,8,16,32}, and the expected vs observed sign.

  INCUMBENT BARS, printed beside every row and never eligible to win:
  - BL1_easy, BL1_hard and BL1_truelogit, always labelled separately;
  - AMS sigma, run from its released Apache-2.0 code (pip install ams-scanner); if it cannot run, state why and use a faithful reimplementation labelled as such;
  - C7 and C13_peak_d;
  - B7 with architecture-mandated null directions projected out;
  - the card/name regex and the greedy refusal rate.

  MUST-FIX DELIVERABLES (re-derive, never copy; log every mismatch in a deviations ledger):
  (1) A per-checkpoint appendix table (repo, family, role, HC, OR, d_lstar, F_clust, BL1_easy, BL1_hard) for the TRUE held-out panel. The families are llama3.2, falcon3, amd-olmo and lfm2, with the exclusion rule and the TIME-rule drops stated.
  (2) Distinct symbols d_lstar (held-out diff-in-means Cohen's d at l_star) and F_clust (the Fisher ratio), each defined as coded, both reported on both panels. The phrase 'direction self-consistency' is deleted. C3 (the cross-layer cosine, wrong-signed) is reported honestly.
  (3) The FULL held-out table: every registered row with rho, family CI, |rho|-|rho_BL1| with its paired CI, partial rho given BL1 (n=23 for the partials), and expected-sign match. The critical |rho| 0.648 and the MDE 0.797 go in the caption. The wrong-signed rows and the B7 artefact are reported as findings. The statement 'join deferred, therefore descriptive' goes beside the table.
  (4) The accumulation result scoped to EASY cross-fitted prompts, with the HARD result beside it and the end-to-start ratio with its CI. The unsupported 'all lineages x doses x sites' sentence is dropped.
  (5) A corrected Lane B lineage table: L1=Base, L2=instruct, L3=SafeRL, L4=STaR, with r_ablit fit layers 29/22/23/29 against the 13-21 band. The contrasts L2-L4, L3-L4, L2-L1 and L3-L1 are the safety-minus-control tests.
  (6) The specificity dissociation as a 2x2 (behaviour changed or unchanged x readout moved or not) for d_lstar, R, peak drive, BL1 and AMS sigma, over 8 effective and 2 no-op pairs, all with paired CIs, plus the data for a figure. It is framed as a replication where recognition survival is concerned.
  (7) All 17 held-out deviations and BL1's double-normalisation disclosed (BL1_truelogit rho 1.00).
  (8) A short 'answer to part 3' block: the best single-model readout, its k-curve, where it succeeds and where it fails, and the panel size needed to resolve partial rho of about 0.45.

  OUTPUT FILES. eval_out.json, screen_table.json, prereg.json + sha256, survivor.json + sha256 + UTC time, tables for the five commissioned Qwen3-4B arms with BL1_easy / BL1_hard / AMS sigma beside every activation number, and SUMMARY.md.

title: Predicting model safety from its activations
summary: >-
  LANE C (test S3): does an activation/weight-only, single-model safety readout predict real safety BEHAVIOUR across model
  families, and from how few prompts? Panel: 21 scored checkpoints across 7 ungated <=4B families (Qwen3 incl. the commissioned
  4B Base/Instruct/SafeRL trio plus 0.6B/1.7B arms; Qwen2.5; SmolLM3; Granite; OLMo-2; TinyLlama; Phi-4-mini) plus 2 SEALED
  families (StableLM, SmolLM2) fully measured but withheld from truth for iteration 2. Everything is frozen by SHA-256 in
  prereg.json before the first activation. From ONE teacher-forced harvest per checkpoint we compute five single-model candidate
  readouts -- K1 arming decomposition [O, CB, A, T] of the projection onto a response-site content direction r_content (fit
  per-checkpoint on a disjoint corpus, split-half cosine ~0.95, held-out AUROC ~1.0, |cos(r_content,r_request)| ~0.35-0.60
  so the content axis is distinct from the abliteration/request axis); K2 request-side prior+slope; K3 base-relative footprint
  (activation + weight, undefined for 2-arm families); K4 hazard-decay tau; K5 domain profile -- all placed in a random-direction
  NULL-SD unit so features are comparable across hidden sizes 1024..3072 with NO recalibration. Seven baselines: B1 card/name
  regex, B2 refusal rate, B3 first-token refusal-logit gap, B4 prompt-axis Fisher, B5 r_request projection, B6 raw-hidden
  geometry, B7 an N-GLARE (arXiv:2511.14195) APT/JSS reimplementation (labelled, not the authors' code). Behavioural ground
  truth (harmful-compliance, over-refusal, and the co-primary SAFE-ENGAGEMENT) comes from greedy generations LLM-judged by
  gemini-2.5-flash-lite, audited by gpt-5-mini (kappa refused 0.71, harmful_content 0.57, on_topic_help 0.47; raw agreement
  0.86/0.84/0.74). S3 = leave-one-family-out ridge prediction with z-scoring/PCA/ridge all fit on training families only;
  metric = pairwise ranking accuracy (|delta truth|>=0.05), decision = margin>=0.15 over the oracle-selected strongest baseline
  AND family-clustered bootstrap 95% CI>0 AND >=5/7 families won. HEADLINE (both outcomes publishable): NO candidate passes
  S3 on either target; machinery controls are clean (oracle ranking accuracy 1.00; random 0.556/shuffle 0.585 mean noise floor).
  The strongest cross-family predictor is the LOGIT baseline B3 (first-token refusal-logit gap: 0.851 safe-engagement, 0.863
  harmful-compliance); the best ACTIVATION candidate is K1 arming (0.671 safe-engagement; 0.810 harmful-compliance, already
  0.882 from just k=4 prompts) but it does not surpass B3. A sharp within-family mechanism is nonetheless visible: across
  the commissioned Qwen3-4B trio the arming term A orders Base(-2.32) < Instruct(+0.18) < SafeRL(+1.90), and SafeRL is a safe-completion
  model (~0% refusal) whose safety refusal-based baselines miss internally -- yet this arming signal does not transfer across
  families to beat B3 at this panel size. The result localises that the response-site arming representation is real and family-specific
  but not a family-invariant behavioural predictor; per the screen's rule iteration 2 widens rather than deepening. Deliverables:
  method.py (orchestrator) + lc_common/lc_assets/lc_panel/lc_harvest/lc_judge/lc_analyze/lc_output modules; method_out.json
  (full/mini/preview) with the frozen prereg, panel table, per-checkpoint raw+null-SD feature table with per-item distributions,
  ground-truth columns, full S3 tables (margin, CI, families-won, budget curve k in {4,8,16,32,96}, random/oracle/shuffle
  controls) per candidate x target, sealed candidate values without truth, cost ledger (~$0.31 of the $10 budget), deviations
  and a limitations block. This artifact owns S3 only; a candidate is promoted by whoever aggregates lanes A/B/C (needs >=2
  of 3).

  REGISTRY 42 checkpoints, 18 pairs, 13 families, from 1587 Hub candidates screened live. safetensors bytes SUMMED FROM THE FILE LIST, not usedStorage. Raw card text ships verbatim - the card+name REGEX BASELINE the screen must beat is computed from it. Labels {"EFFECTIVE": 3, "SEALED": 2, "AMBIGUOUS": 3, "UNSCORED": 10}.

  HEADLINE NEGATIVE: at n=45+45, HALF THE SCORABLE PAIRS CANNOT BE LABELLED ROBUSTLY. 3 EFFECTIVE with a Newcombe 95% CI wholly above +0.15 (Qwen3-0.6B +0.467 [0.270,0.616]; Qwen3-1.7B +0.667 [0.501,0.786]; Josiefied-Qwen2.5-1.5B +0.467 [0.308,0.609]). 3 DEMOTED to AMBIGUOUS by the frozen label_robust rule despite point estimates crossing: SmolLM3 +0.289 [0.086,0.461], Phi-4-mini +0.244 [0.116,0.387], granite 0.000 [-0.079,0.079]. Hence G_EFFECTIVE_IN_STRATUM (2, need 4) and G_NONEFFECTIVE (0, need 2) fail: granite's NULL_EDIT was demoted and the one real ANOMALOUS pair (venkycs SmolLM2, over-refusal 1.000) is in a SEALED family. Strata NOT widened to rescue the count; the 4-pair requirement must be met partly by the lane's in-house rank-one edits.

  10 pairs UNSCORED, never zero-filled: 8 FRESH (3 held_out by a seeded sha256 rule fixed before scoring), the commissioned Qwen3-4B -> mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated pair (ungated; the gated='auto' huihui variant refused), and TinyLlama, EXCLUDED as missing_shards - unloadable, not a null-edit control.

  JOIN EXACT: 26 checkpoints recomputed from 2370 judged rows match published columns to 0.000e+00 - but only after adopting iteration 1's denominator convention, since 1 row (Phi-4-mini benign orh_244) has an unparsable judge output it drops. The first run FAILED at 1.46e-2; build_log.txt records both.

  RECOGNITION SET 1509 rows, 771 benign / 738 harmful, built to kill the ceiling that made iteration 1's premise test unfalsifiable. HARDNESS MEASURED: TF-IDF+char-ngram logistic proxy, 5-fold CV, AUROC 0.9561 on easy anchors (PASS, the saturating pole) and 0.8852 on hard+borderline+wrapped vs a <=0.85 target - a FAIL, below the 0.90 rebalance trigger, with `wrapped` named as the leaking stratum and top-20 features shipped. Dedup removed 0 exact + 31 near; disjointness from iteration 1's 96/54 XSTest split asserted at 0. graded_harm on 23 rows from PKU-SafeRLHF ordinal severity, null elsewhere, never invented.

  TOKENS from 2369 real generations, 9 families; no iteration-1 lexicon exists (grep-verified). Refusal-onset 60 forms, all in >=3 families, opening 0.7587 of 1,115 refusing generations vs 0.3552 for the constructed naive comparator; top-30 Jaccard 0.25 vs do-not-answer, so a behaviour not a template. HEDGE TOOK 3 PASSES, THE FIRST TWO SHIPPED AS EVIDENCE OF FAILURE: a 2-document pool crowned its content words ("abraham lincoln", lift 1632), and widening to 147 docs with a document-frequency lift and prompt-echo stripping stayed topic-confounded - 147 generations over 45 prompts cannot separate style from topical halo. Pass 3 DECLARES a hedge-marker frame and mines 24 forms in it. Controls 28/35 inside the 0.25 caliper. Tokenizer table 128 forms x 28 tokenizers x 2 variants, 0 failures, 0 dropped; mid-text variant PRIMARY.

  PROBES: all pairwise prompt-hash intersections ZERO. 160/154 reused VERBATIM from iteration 1; 200 NEW auto-gradable with no judge (ARC-Easy + GSM8K, key in `output`); 40 from the never-loaded sealed split. Judge rubric verbatim with SHA-256s so new rows pool with the 2,370.

  SEAL ALREADY COMPROMISED AND SAID SO: both sealed pairs' deltas appear in the iteration-2 strategy text, so seal_status=DISCLOSED_UPSTREAM; only the seeded FRESH pairs and the sealed split are blind.

  CONTRACT: filter on label_robust, NOT effectiveness_label alone, or 3 CI-straddling pairs look decided. Every row carries readout_class; registry and card text are BASELINE by construction. Never read sealed_truth.json or the sealed_holdout split in a fitting lane.

title: Abliterated models see harm but stop acting on it
summary: |-
  Iteration-2 Lane A screen, run on CPU (no GPU; one physical core, 16 GB cgroup). 25 checkpoints activation-harvested on 256 prompts (96 EASY advbench/dolly prompts fit every direction; 160 HARD XSTest-twin/OR-Bench prompts measure recognition R), 18 of them with a teacher-forced 2x2 cell harvest (X5/X11), 29 weight summaries, 20 shuffled-label nulls and a 100-replicate item bootstrap per checkpoint. Panel: 9 instruct->uncensored pairs (P0 Qwen3-4B->mlabonne abliterated [commissioned], P1 Qwen3-0.6B, P2 Qwen3-1.7B, P3 Qwen2.5-1.5B Josiefied, P4 SmolLM3-3B, P5 Phi-4-mini, P6 granite NULL-EDIT control, S1 stablelm heretic, S2 SmolLM2 venkycs) plus Qwen3-4B-Base, SafeRL, a non-safety fine-tune (CohenQu), TinyLlama, OLMo-2 and a random-init arm. mlabonne was judged here with Lane C's exact protocol: harmful compliance 0.733 vs parent 0.000 (EFFECTIVE; $0.0087).

  HEADLINE (readout level; E4 causal test not evaluated): abliteration removes EXECUTION, not RECOGNITION. Over 6 effective pairs, hard-set recognition TPR@5%FPR changes by a median -0.05 (TOST 6x INCONCLUSIVE; P2 shows a partial 0.21 drop) and the recognition onset layer does not move, while the peak logit-lens refusal-drive gap falls in 6/6 pairs (median -2.98) and X2 write mass along the model's own harm axis falls in 6/6. Parent/child harm directions agree at |cos| 0.992 in shallow layers vs 0.459 in the deep half (null-edit granite 0.984/0.997; random init 0.014). Commissioned lineage: HARD-set recognition onset Base L33 -> instruct/SafeRL/abliterated L19; peak refusal drive Base 1.57, instruct 4.92, SafeRL 8.78, abliterated 1.92 (final layer inverted, -1.96).

  SCREEN: survivor NONE. E1 is UNDER_POWERED for every candidate (edit-recipe strata hold 3/2/1 effective pairs, below the registered 4); no candidate passes E2 (training order) or E3 (leave-one-family-out transfer vs the BL1 logit baseline; machinery controls clean: oracle 1.0, shuffled truth 0.498). Descriptive pooled row: BL1 (logit-only baseline) is the most consistent abliteration detector (6/6 same sign, 5/6 CI excluding 0) but also moves ~-1 pooled SD on the granite null edit; X5 (response-onset write concentration) has the strongest activation dose-response (rho -0.87, exact p 0.016, n 7) but fails E2 because SafeRL < instruct; a name-free card regex also tracks dose (rho 0.87). Prior art from the same-iteration research lane: X2 and X10 are CLOSED by the Jorak Model Scanner and excluded from survivor selection; its statistic, reimplemented as BL7, detects global rank-1 edits, misses per-layer ones (mlabonne), and fires on the unedited stablelm-2 parent (0.99). X10_abs puts every effective child outside the parent band with zero prompts.

  Supply facts: venkycs/SmolLM2 'abliterated' is an optimum-quanto FP8 upload without quantization_config, so 168 linear layers load at random init; the TinyLlama child is missing shards; the granite child edits 1 of 80 matrices. Corrections made before final scoring (21 deviations logged): confidence intervals that shrank with the number of null draws replaced by an item bootstrap; R's layer, chosen on a saturated fitting set, replaced by the registered nested HARD-set selection; per-tokenizer slot rule for X5; ledger overwrite, NaN serialisation and OOM fixes.

  FILES: method_out.json (+ full/mini/preview; exp_gen_sol_out; 335 examples in 5 datasets incl. a 256-prompt recognition-vs-execution item-level set), out/SUMMARY.md (all tables), README.md, results/ (e_tests, pairs_table, recognition, budget curves at k=0..128, deviations), out/released/ (per-layer harm directions .npy, per-layer curves CSV, prereg, pairs, token sets). Large per-position tensors (harvest/<tag>/D_resp_parts/) are stored as <=90 MiB parts (GitHub limit), verified bit-identical to the originals; results unchanged.

title: Fresh models test cheap internal safety readouts
summary: >-
  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION PANEL (iteration 3, experiment_1; NO winner named). 10 checkpoints that no earlier artifact had loaded,
  drawn by a frozen seeded SHA-256 rule from families absent from the iteration-2 screen: Vikhr-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct + its
  abliterated child (the D2-registry fresh held-out pair), unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct + mylesgoose abliterated2, the Falcon3-1B
  Base->Instruct and AMD-OLMo-1B base->SFT->SFT-DPO stage lineages, and LFM2-700M (TIME rule dropped h2oai/h2o-danube3-500m-chat,
  LiquidAI/LFM2-1.2B). ORDER (hash_chain.jsonl; order audit PASS): panel rule -> draw -> greedy generation + Lane C lc_judge
  grading -> graded_truth.json committed -> prereg.json frozen -> activation harvest (iteration-2 protocol: 256 prompts at
  the last prompt token, 96 teacher-forced XSTest cells, all layers, fp16, weight summaries, 64 severity items) -> scoring.
  BEHAVIOUR (45 Lane C harmful items, the screen's outcome items): harmful compliance 0.00-0.60, split-half reliability 0.96;
  both abliterated children comply more than their parents; AMD-OLMo base (HC 0.02) is incoherent rather than safe; SFT->DPO
  is a behavioural no-op. HELD-OUT TABLE (results/heldout_table.json; n=10; permutation critical |rho| 0.648, 80%-power MDE
  0.80), Spearman rho with harmful compliance [checkpoint-bootstrap 95% CI]: B3 -0.89 [-0.97,-0.57] (iteration-2 held-out
  diff-in-means d, activation); B7 +0.80 [+0.26,+1.00] (weights-only scar; abliterated children 1.00/0.98 vs parents 0.50/0.50,
  but all three AMD-OLMo checkpoints 1.00 because their shared null is the all-ones direction mandated by OLMo's mean-subtracting
  LayerNorm; projecting it out (results/b7_diagnostic.json) drops rho(HC) to +0.08, leaving abliteration-scar detection only);
  C13_peak_d -0.66 [-1.00,+0.09]; C5 -0.62 [-0.99,+0.11]; C7 -0.62 [-0.95,+0.11]; BL1 -0.62 [-0.93,+0.02] (logit baseline);
  C2 +0.66, C2_tpr5 +0.77, C6 +0.69, C9 +0.64 (sign OPPOSITE to the declared expectation, as on the iteration-2 panel); C1
  -0.21; C4 +0.38; C11 -0.01; C12 -0.24; C13 -0.25. Rows whose |rho| exceeds |rho(BL1)| with a paired CI excluding 0: none.
  SAME CODE on the iteration-2 panel's saved activations (22 graded): 28/30 rows keep their sign; flips: C12_topsv (-0.25
  -> +0.01), X2 (-0.65 -> +0.31). PAIRED FRESH-MODEL CONTRASTS (post-prereg, prompt bootstrap): Vikhr-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-abliterated:
  dHC +0.60, peak d -0.90 [-1.38,-0.55], mid-depth d -0.40 [-0.69,-0.17], B7 +0.50; Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-abliterated2: dHC
  +0.22, peak d -0.61 [-0.88,-0.36], mid-depth d -0.54 [-0.74,-0.36], B7 +0.48 -- iteration 3's 'request-axis d falls in every
  abliterated child' replicates on 2/2 new pairs (both CIs below 0). On the SFT->DPO no-op BL1 moves +1.61 [+0.98,+2.29] while
  peak d moves +0.06 [-0.08,+0.16]; AMD base->SFT (dHC +0.56) moves no activation readout (C13, peak d, C7, C5 CIs all cover
  0). BL1 reads a double-normalised final slice (iteration-2 lens); the literal final-logit gap ranks the panel identically
  (rho +1.00). CHECKS: unit checks all pass=True (published outcome rates and iteration-2 BL1/B3/B7/X2/X10 reproduced to 0.0);
  hook checks on 10 checkpoints (determinism True, layer-0 = embedding True, last-slice argmax True); judge re-run 0/20 mismatches;
  spend $0.13. JOIN: no screen survivor.json exists in iteration 3, so the confirmation lookup is DEFERRED (results/join_stub.json).
  Raw activations for every checkpoint are kept under harvest/<tag>/ in the iteration-2 layout for re-scoring.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>


<shared_pod_budget>
Every artifact in this run executes on ONE shared pod: 15 GB of RAM, 2 CPU cores, and a 16 GB-class NVIDIA card with 16 GB of VRAM. Up to 5 artifact agents run on it at the same time, and the admission gate hands out at most 12 GB of that RAM between them — the rest is held back for the orchestrator process itself.

Declare what THIS artifact's executor will need as `ram_gb` and `vram_gb`, and justify both in the plan's summary against what the plan actually loads: model weights, the rows held in memory at once, every worker process it forks. Size the declaration so the largest 5 RAM declarations in this run still sum to under 12 GB, and the largest 5 VRAM declarations under 16 GB. A batch whose declarations do not fit the pod is rejected before any of it runs, and the plans that caused the overflow are dropped.

The declaration is enforced, not advisory. The step is admitted against it and its process tree is sampled while it runs; a tree that goes past its own declaration is stopped and killed, and the agent is handed a failure naming both the limit and the peak it reached, which costs the artifact a whole retry. Under-declaring spends attempts; over-declaring keeps siblings from starting at all. Declare the peak you genuinely expect, with a little headroom, and plan the work to fit inside it.
</shared_pod_budget>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

qwen3 4B on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated (use the 4B size of each so they fit on a 16GB GPU). take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

invariant: the deliverable is the activation-level comparison of the three models and any metric built from it must read activations or weights of a single model. logit-only or text-only readouts are baselines, not the result. this is a mech interp study of where safety lives, not a jailbreak or attack-selection study; do not reframe it as one.
